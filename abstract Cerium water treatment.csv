The catalysts have been characterized by different techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance (UV-vis DRS) and Raman spectroscopy. XRD results showed that Ce3+ ions were successfully incorporated into the ZnO lattice. UV-vis DRS spectra evidenced that Ce–ZnO samples present band-gap values of about 2.97 eV, lower than those of undoped ZnO (3.21 eV). These various photocatalysts, at 0.1 g L−1 in saline 0.85%, were used to inactivate Escherichia coli previously isolated from an urban wastewater treatment plant. Higher atomic ratios of Ce in the ZnO lattice, as confirmed by XRD and Raman spectroscopy, showed significant improvements to the inactivation rate; the resulting recommended optimum cerium loading of 0.04:1 Ce:Zn gave multiple orders of magnitude higher rate of inactivation after 60 min of treatment when compared to un-doped ZnO.

Place and Duration of Study: Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, October 6 university (Medical Unit IV) and Inorganic laboratory, Central laboratory, Greater Cairo Drinking Water Company, Fustat water treatment plant, between June 2012 and Jan. 2013. Methodology: Nile water samples were taken from water intake throughout the fustat plant, treated with different doses of huwa-san and chlorine to evaluate their effect on the levels of water contained from Al, Zn, Cr, Ni, Fe, Pb and Cu. Results: It was found that the treatment with huwa-san more effective than chlorine in decreasing Al, Zn, Cr, Ni and Cu at the most doses. Also, it is more effective than chlorine in decreasing Fe and Pb concentrations at the doses 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 ppm while at the dose 7 ppm, the chlorine becomes more effective than huwa-san in decreasing concentration of these elements. Mn showed different results. The chlorine decreased Mn obviously more than huwa-san at all the doses. On the other hand, both of chlorine and huwa-san have the same effect on Zn only at the doses 2 and 3 ppm. The chlorine decreased Ni concentration more than huwa-san at the doses 2 and 3 ppm but huwa-san becomes more effective at the other doses. The results showed that the disinfection with huwa-san more effective results than chlorine at the same doses. 4 ppm of huwa-san represents the most suitable disinfection dose used during the treatment process.

Compared to other adsorbents for heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions, LDH materials possessed many advantages such as nontoxic synthesis, chemical stability, environmentally friendly, and facile separation from the water solution. The synthesis of LDH was achieved by a co-precipitation method. The reaction products were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy and N2 sorption–desorption isotherm analysis. The adsorption rates were investigated. The effect of the parameters such as contact time, initial metal ion concentration, and temperature on the adsorption of the Pb(II) was studied. Equilibrium was achieved in 60 min and the equilibrium adsorption capacity was found to be increased with the increase in the Pb(II) initial concentration. The removal efficiency of Pb(II) increases from 59.50% to 71.15% when the temperature increases from 15°C to 60°C. The pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and Elovich kinetic models were tested and the first was found to fit better to the experimental data. The application of the intra-particle diffusion model demonstrates that the surface diffusion and the intra-particle diffusion occur in parallel during the adsorption of Pb(II) onto MgFeAl-CO3. The equilibrium adsorption data were analyzed by Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson, and Temkin isotherm models. The results indicated that the Redlich–Peterson and Langmuir isotherms were the most suitable models for the obtained experimental data and the Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity of the MgFeAl-CO3 is found to be 117.86 mg g-1 at 298.15 K. The thermodynamic analysis of the adsorption of Pb(II) on MgFeAl-CO3 reveals that the present adsorption process is a spontaneous and endothermic reaction.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/b9cb9cec-b118-41bf-85db-b4cd1966900c/A.%20Ait%20Ichou%20et%20al.%20DesWater%202020%20%28abstract%29.pdf,pdf

Carp (Cyprinus carpio) were exposed to treatments of nano-CeO2 (1 & 100 mg/L) and micro-CeO2 (100 mg/L, mean particle size 200 nm) dispersed in water containing 10 mg/L humic acid for 10 days. As a separate treatment, carp were fed nano-CeO2 at 68 mg/kg in diet for 10 days. Fish samples were collected on 3 occasions (at day 1, 4, 10), and water samples every third day. All samples were immediately analyzed for Ce by ICP-MS. The uptake of Ce was evaluated in selected tissues (liver, gastrointestinal tract, gills, skin and filet) and the carcass from dissected fish. The highest amounts of Ce were found in the gastrointestinal tract in both feeding and water exposures. In skin and gills considerably lower amounts of Ce were found. In internal tissues such as liver and filet measured Ce was generally below the quantification limit, with a few exceptions that were most likely due to contamination during dissection. The results indicate that there is a very low bioaccumulation potential for CeO2 (BCF <5 and BMF <0.002).

Environmental pollution abatement for a multitude of everyday industrial and domestic activities demands cleaner and efficient water treatment technology. Water treatment refers to the procedures that are used to make water more suitable for a specific purpose. It could be used for a variety of purposes, including residential, industrial, medical and many more. All water treatment procedures aim to remove existing toxins and make the water safe to drink. Water treatment encompasses both the treatment of water prior to its use and the treatment of waste water generated after its use. Sewage, residential, agricultural, and industrial waste water treatment are all included in this category. For the aforementioned sorts of water treatment processes, a variety of approaches are available. All have advantages and disadvantages, as well as convenience of use, economic efficiency, and end usage, which influence their selection. Nanotechnology has just made its way into the field of water treatment. Many different forms of nanomaterials are being studied and employed in water treatment systems. Desalination, purification, and wastewater treatment are all areas where nanotechnology has considerable potential. Desalination costs can be drastically reduced because to nanotechnology applications.

series of experiments, it is found that the blends subjected to high
speed blending followed by ultrasonic bath stabilization improves the
stability. In the second phase, performance characteristics are studied
using the stable fuel blends in a single cylinder four stroke engine

19,IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIAL FEATURES IN THE ELECTROLYSIS­CAVITATION WATER TREATMENT IN POOLS,10.15587/1729-4061.2019.162229,"Liliya Shevchuk, Ivan Aftanaziv, Lesya Strutynska, Orysia Strogan, Igor Samsin",2019-04-30,"We developed an innovative technology of electrolysis-cavitation water purification and water treatment in pools. This method belongs to the group of physical water purification methods and its advantage is the absence of the need for costly chemical disinfectants and a degree of water purification from biological and organic pollutants of up to 97–98 %. A typical electrolytic water treatment process, based on electrolysis disengagement of sodium chloride with the formation of reactive sodium hypochlorite, is complemented by the operation of water cavitation disinfection from organic and biological pollutants. Prior to the electrolysis, the cavitation treatment of water in pools reduces by 75‒80 % the degree of its contamination, reduces approximately by two times the need in disinfectant produced by electrolysis installations. This proportionally reduces by 45–50 % the duration of energy-consuming electrolysis equipment operation and reduces by one-third the costs of electricity for water treatment operations.
For cavitation disinfection of water in pools, we have devised a new design of an industrial variant of the vibrocavitator with a resonance effect, studied the conditions for disturbing the cavitation processes within it, and developed a procedure for the design and calculation of its main components and parts. The block of vibrocavitators that precedes electrolysis water treatment ensures the oxidation of organic impurities in polluted water, including urea, to 75–77 %. The degree of biological water disinfection in this case reaches 80–82 % with a capacity of 3–3.5 m3/hour.
The power of electromagnets in a vibrocavitator drive is 1–1.5 kW, which is an order of magnitude less compared to the power of electrolysis installations. Given this, the proposed phased cavitation and electrolysis water treatment reduces the total energy consumption for a water treatment operation. For standard pools with a water volume of 3,000 m3 with electrolysis water treatment, the introduction of additional cavitation treatment will make it possible to reduce monthly energy consumption for a water treatment operation by about 1,200‒1,500 kW.
We have considered the legal aspects for implementing the proposed solutions in terms of the production implementation of the electrolysis-cavitation water treatment process and improving the safety of users of water procedures and services",https://zenodo.org/api/files/01b0d5b9-c3e6-4d3c-99fe-e97dd1b3c9f4/Identification%20of%20special%20features%20in%20the%20electrolysis%C2%ADcavitation%20water%20treatment%20in%20pools.pdf,pdf

Ballast water has been a principal pathway of nonindigenous species introduction to global ports for much of the 20th century. In an effort to reduce the scale of this pathway, and recognizing forthcoming global regulations that will supplant ballast water exchange (BWE) with ballast water treatment (BWT), we explore whether a combined hybrid treatment of BWE and chlorination (Cl) exceeds individual effects of either BWE or chlorination alone in reducing densities of bacteria, microplankton and macroplankton. 2. Five full-scale trials were conducted on an operational bulk carrier travelling between Canada and Brazil. 3. The hybrid treatment generally had the lowest final densities among all treatments for putative enterococci, Escherichia coli, and coliform bacteria, as well as microplankton and macroplankton, with the former two being synergistically lower than individual treatments alone. Microplankton abundance in the hybrid treatment was significantly but antagonistically reduced relative to individual treatments alone. Macroplankton final density was lowest in the hybrid treatment, though the interaction between treatments was not significant. 4. Synthesis and applications. In most cases the combined hybrid treatment of ballast water exchange (BWE) and chlorination reduced population densities of indicator organisms in ballast water below those proposed by the International Maritime Organization's D-2 performance standards. BWE alone was often ineffective at reducing bacterial and macroplankton densities. Even when performance standards are implemented globally, continued use of BWE could further reduce risk of invasions to freshwater ecosystems that receive ballast water from foreign sources by accentuating the decline in propagule pressure and enhancing demographic constraints for putative invaders.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/c0cfcbf2-d702-4527-8b2c-1786d6e98bc5/Data%20Accessibility-Hybrid%20system%20increases%20efficiency%20of%20ballast%20water%20treatment.xlsx,xlsx

The oxidation of succinic acid by cerium(IV) has been studied spectrophotometrically in aqueous sulphuric acid medium at 298 K at constant ionic strength or 1.6 mol dm-3. A minute amount or ruthenium(lll) (10-6 mol dm-3) is sumcient to enhance the slow reaction between succinic acid and cerium(JV). The main reaction products are cerium(lll) and oxaloacetic acid. The stoichiometry is 1 : 4, that is[sue.acid] : [CeIV] == 1 : 4. The reaction is first order in both cerium(IV) and ruthnium(lll) concentrations. The order with respect to sue. acid concentration varies from first order to zero order, as the succinic acid concentration increases. Increase in sulphuric acid concentration decreases the reaction rate. The added sulphate and bisulpahte decreases the rate or reaction. The added product cerium(lll) retards the reaction rate. The active species or oxidant and catalyst are Ce(SO4)2 and [Ru(H2O)6]3+ respectively. Possible mechanism Is proposed.

The reaction shows first order kinetics in [CeIV] and an apparent less than unit order dependence each in [DL-methionine] and [acid]. The data suggest that the oxidation proceeds via the formation of a complex between methionine and cerium(IV) which decomposes in a slow step to give a free radical which on reacting with one more molecule of cerium(IV) in a fast step gives the products.

Water samples from six Treatment plants and their respective twelve connections (two from each treatment plant) were collected before and after treatment. In this way, total samples were collected and tested. Values of these samples before and after treatment were used for comparison with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for drinking water standards. Thirty-three parameters including physical, chemical, and bacteriological were determined for each sample. The results were satisfactory both chemically and bacteriologically according to WHO guidelines for water quality of treatment plants. The results showed that the samples of water were fit, both before and after treatment plant except for water sample of treatment plant No. IV & V (Before treatment). Total and fecal coliform were found in these samples. Various causes of fecal contamination before treatment may be due to leakage of pipelines, operation at tube wells, the layout of freshwater pipes parallel or beneath the sewerage pipes or channels. Disinfection of water at the source is recommended to deal with the fecal contamination; otherwise, there is no need for a filtration plant.

A minute (10-8 mol dm-3) quantity of iodide mediated oxidation of arsenic(III) by cerium(IV) in an aqueous sulphuric acid and sulphate media has been studied spectrophotometrically at 25 °C. The stoichiometry is 1 : 2, i.e. one mole of arsenic(lll) requires two moles of cerium(IV). The reaction is first order each in cerium(IV) and iodide concentrations. The order with respect to arsenic(lll) is less than unity. Increase in sulphuric acid concentration increased the rate. In situ H+ ion concentration is calculated by the knowledge of equilibrium constants and the order with respect to H+ ion concentration is found to be less than unity. The ionic strength did not have any significant effect on the rate of reaction, whereas rate constant increased with decreasing dielectric constant of the medium. Added products cerium(lll) and arsenic(V) did not have any significant effect on the reaction rate. The active species of oxidant and reductant are Ce(SO4)2+ and Asl2+ respectively. A suitable mechanism is proposed. The catalytic constant and activation parameters are determined. The.results obtained in the present study are similar to that of bromide, chloride and iodide mediated oxidation of antimony(III) by cerium(IV) in aqueous sulphuric acid-sulfate media and are compared and discussed.

Using thin epitaxial films of ordered CeOx we investigate the influence of oxygen vacancy concentration and coordination on the oxidation of CeOx by water. Upon changing the CeOx stoichiometry from CeO2 to Ce2O3, we observe a transition from a slow surface reaction to a productive H2-evolving CeOx oxidation with reaction yields exceeding the surface capacity and indicating the participation of bulk OH species. Both the experiments and the ab-initio calculations associate the effective oxidation of highly-reduced CeOx by water to the network of next-nearest-neighbor oxygen vacancies present in the bixbyite c-Ce2O3 phase. Next- nearest-neighbor oxygen vacancies allow for the effective incorporation of water in the bulk via formation of OH- groups. Bulk hydroxylation is proved to be absent in other CeOx phases, where the average distance between oxygen vacancies is larger than in the c-Ce2O3. Our study illustrates that the coordination of oxygen vacancies in CeOx represents an important parameter to be considered in understanding and improving the reactivity of ceria-based catalysts.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/3d8ca45e-c976-4c9c-8ee0-d495b54c62b9/paper_ACS_catalysis.pdf,pdf

The objective of this research is to analyze the behavior, knowledge and practices of households relating drinking water treatment methods in the district of Ahomadégbé with a view to proposing adequate measures for improving the quality of drinking water.
As part of this research, the questionnaire was used to approach 377 residents individually and 82 participants were organized into eight focus groups to understand the behavior, knowledge and practices of population.
The results show that more than 65% of the population of the borough have knowledge of certain process of treating water at home.
But they find themselves limited in the application of these different water treatment methods and only 6.1% of the population used at least one home water treatment method, even if this is not always appropriated.
The water treatment methods residents used were Alum (KAl(SO4)2∙12 H2O, chemical decantation method), filtration on tissues, and disinfection by boiling. The populations resort to other techniques of water treatment at home such as the use of oil and cresol which prove ineffective.
The population is aware of water contamination during transport and storage. However, most residents interviewed do not treat water before consumption, and the few who treat it resort to unsuitable methods.

produce water that satisfies a set of drinking water quality standards
at a reasonable price to the consumers. The gravel-bed flocculator
provide a simple and inexpensive design for flocculation in small
water treatment plants (less than 5000 m3/day capacity). The packed
bed of gravel provides ideal conditions for the formation of compact
settleable flocs because of continuous recontact provided by the
sinuous flow of water through the interstices formed by the gravel.
The field data which were obtained from the operation of the
water supply treatment unit cover the physical, chemical and
biological water qualities of the raw and settled water as obtained by
the operation of the treatment unit. The experiments were carried out
with the aim of assessing the efficiency of the gravel filter in
removing the turbidity, pathogenic bacteria, from the raw water. The
water treatment plant, which was constructed for the treatment of
river water, was in principle a rapid sand filter.
The results show that the average value of the turbidity level of
the settled water was 4.83 NTU with a standard deviation of turbidity
2.893 NTU. This indicated that the removal efficiency of the
sedimentation tank (gravel filter) was about 67.8 %. for pH values
fluctuated between 7.75 and 8.15, indicating the alkaline nature of
the raw water of the river Shatt Al-Hilla, as expected. Raw water pH
is depressed slightly following alum coagulation. The pH of the
settled water ranged from 7.75 to a maximum of 8.05.
The bacteriological tests which were carried out on the water
samples were: total coliform test, E-coli test, and the plate count test.
In each test the procedure used was as outlined in the Standard

The reaction between cerium(IV) and N-(2-hydroxyethyl)phthalimide (NHEP) is very slow in sulphuric acid medium at 25 ºC. However, the reaction is facile in presence of ethylenediamminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in aqueous sulphuric acid medium. The reaction between cerium(IV) and NHEP in presence of EDTA exhibits 1 : 1 (oxidant : reductant) stoichiometry. The products are identified as cerium(III)-EDTA complex, n-methylphthalimide and formaldehyde. The order with respect to oxidant concentration is unity, whereas the order with respect to both substrate and catalyst concentration is less than unity. Increase in sulphuric acid concentration increases the rate of reaction. The order with respect to H+ ion concentration is less than unity. The added product cerium(III), did not have any significant effect on the rate of reaction in presence of EDTA. The active species of oxidant is identified as CeSO42+. Based on the experimental results a suitable mechanism is proposed.

Water that has been used or contaminated by humans or the environment must undergo wastewater treatment in order to be returned to a usable state. The treatment may involve one or more of the following mechanisms: chemical, biological, physical, or a combination of these. Any level of purity can be achieved by treating water, but the expense increases as the purity increases. The needed water quality depends on the intended use of the water, such as irrigation, drinking water, or aquatic life. The purpose of research is to examine the wastewater treatment technology that is now most widely utilized. The technology selected for one application may not be the best for another.

The obtained results indicate that the pre-treatment of the aluminum substrate and the additional phosphate treatment of the Ce-oxide conversion coating deposited on Al 1050 have a strong impact on corrosion-protective effect. We established that the phosphate treatments lead to a transformation of the chemical composition, chemical state of the elements, structure and morphology of the Ce-oxide coatings formed on Al substrates. Oxides and phosphates of Al and Ce are formed, providing an effective barrier to the diffusion of Chloride ions towards the metal surface and increased corrosion resistance (Rp) of Al 1050 to general and pitting corrosion.

Bhamare",2018-10-09,"India is facing a water crisis and by 2025 it is estimated that India's population will be suffering from severe water scarcity. International Water management Institute IWMI predicts that by 2025, one in three Indians will live in a condition of absolute water scarcity. Water from the industries, households, etc. has been discharged into the streams without being treated first. Thus, clean water has become a luxury in many water scarce areas. Due to the consumption of contaminated water, people are falling prey to water borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, etc. The widely used approach to counter such problem has been the use of water treatment plants in cities and towns and water filters in households. However, in a developing country like India water treatment plants and filters in small villages are a rare sight. The major reason for this is the funds required. Also, the processes that are in existence for water treatment are primarily chemical based. With the discovery of processes like phytoremediation, it has become possible to incorporate biological processes in water treatment Piyush Gupta et al. 2012 . Moreover the voids between broken bricks, etc. can be used to trap sediments. Natural coagulants such as moringa oleifera can be used to remove colloidal impurities Abirami. M and Rohini C 2017 . Thus, this assembly of scrap or natural material is not only cheap and easily available but it is also efficient in removing the impurities and improving the BOD, COD and DO levels Nayanthara and Bindu 2017 . This implies that such assemblies can be used to treat water on a household level. This study aims at developing such easy to use and effective water treatment assemblies.

considered (i) conventional secondary treatment without recycle (ii) conventional treatment
with recycle (iii) only primary treatment. Bench top model of sewage treatment plant is set up
and experiments are conducted for the above options. pH, TS, TSS, BOD and COD values
are determined in the laboratory to determine the efficiency of the treatment plant. Cow dung

The simultaneous measurements of the bovine serum albumine adsorption and zeta potential determination of the (adsorption) suspensions were carried out. The adsorption isotherms were found to be of typical Langmuir type; values of the bovine serum albumin adsorption capacities were calculated. Increasing of pH led to decrease of zeta potential and decrease of adsorption capacity of cerium oxide nano-particles. The maximum adsorption capacity was found for strongly acid suspension (am=118 mg/g). The samples of nanoceria with positive zeta potential adsorbed more bovine serum albumine on the other hand, the samples with negative zeta potential showed little or no protein adsorption.

of contact time, nZVI doses, pH, ionic strength, temperature, and concentration on nZVI adsorption
properties was assessed. The removal of Cu(II) and Zn(II) increased with pH from 3 to 7 and then
stabilized up to pH 10. Moreover, the increased Cu(II) adsorption capacity upon increasing temperature
and a positive enthalpy change (ΔH) indicate that the adsorption process is endothermic. The results
also showed that the adsorption equilibrium for Cu(II) and Zn(II) was achieved after 50 and 30 min,

It is matter of concern because its presence is now proved in almost all the essential things related to human beings. Most of the MPs enter the body of living organisms through food, water and air. Hence, it become important to monitor these things regularly for presence of MPs. With all these facts, the present study was designed to investigate the microplastic removal capacity of the drinking water treatment plant at Srinagar, Garhwal, Uttarakhand, India. For the study water samples were collected from the different treatment stages of water treatment Plant. The samples were then digested with H2O2 and filtered to observed under microscope. The SEM and XRD analysis were also performed to enhance the clarity of plastic present in the samples. On visual inspection and microscopical study we found presence of microplastic in all the stages of treatment plant. The presence of thread/fibre were found dominant in the samples of treatment plant. Overall, it was concluded that the with the progress of stages of treatment plant the value of MPs decreased but its presence was also found in the final stage from where the water is supplied to different houses.

Any physical, chemical or biological condition that prevents the designated uses of a water body represents poor water quality. Effluent water is always associated with environmental and human health problems. Many wastewater treatment plants were designed to remove nutrients and pathogens. However, there are many factors that lead to their failure to perform effectively. A study was carried out at Hatcliffe Sewage Treatment Works (HSTW), a major supplier of water to upper parts of Chinyika River in Zimbabwe. The effluent pollution level was analyzed. Chemical water quality parameters were analyzed according to the standard methods for analysis of water and wastewater and biological water quality was based on results obtained by Matenga (2004). It was found that HSTW affects the quality of water in upper Chinyika River chemically and biologically. It was also inferred that upgrading the wastewater treatment plant cannot alone achieve improved water quality. However, integrating sediment dredging, enhancing public participation, institutional cooperation and internalizing of environmental externalities could improve water quality of upper Chinyika River.

This comes along with a tremendous chemicalization of the globe, including ubiquitous presence of products of chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the aquatic environment. Use of these products will increase with population growth and living standard as will the need for clean water. In addition, climate change will exacerbate availability of water in sufficient quantity and quality. Since its implementation, conventional wastewater treatment has increasingly contributed to environmental protection and health of humans. However, with the increasing pollution of water by chemicals, conventional treatment turned out to be insufficient. It was also found that advanced effluent treatment methods such as extended filtration, the sorption to activated charcoal or advanced oxidation methods have their own limitations. These are, for example, increased demand for energy and hazardous chemicals, incomplete or even no removal of pollutants, the generation of unwanted products from parent compounds (transformation products, TPs) of often-unknown chemical structure, fate and toxicity. In many countries, effluent treatment is available only rarely if at all let alone advanced treatment. The past should teach us, that focusing only on technological approaches is not constructive for a sustainable water quality control. Therefore, in addition to conventional and advanced treatment optimization more emphasis on input prevention is urgently needed, including more and better control of what is present in the source water. Measures for input prevention are known for long. The main focus though has always been on the treatment, and measures taken at the source have gained only little attention so far. A more effective and efficient approach, however, would be to avoid pollution at the source, which would in turn allow more targeted treatment to meet treated water quality objectives globally. New developments within green and sustainable chemistry are offering new approaches that allow for input prevention and a more targeted treatment to succeed in pollution elimination in and at the source. To put this into practice, engineers, water scientists and chemists as well as microbiologists and scientists of other related disciplines need to cooperate more extensively than in the past. Applying principles such as the precautionary principle, or keeping water flows separate where possible will add to this. This implies not minimizing the efforts to improve wastewater treatment but to design effluents and chemicals in such a way that treatment systems and water environments can cope successfully with the challenge of micropollutants globally (Kümmerer et al., 2018). This paper therefore presents in its first part some of the limitations of effluent treatment in order to demonstrate the urgent need for minimizing water pollution at the source and, information on why source management is urgently needed to improve water quality and stimulate discussions how to protect water resources on a global level.

Failings in water management were at the heart of local grievances: an outbreak of water-related illnesses was triggered by the use of polluted water from the Shatt al-Arab, Basra’s main source of water. Given the devastating outcomes of the outbreak, Basra started to heavily depend on the Bada’a Canal, the main source of freshwater for Basra. However, the deterioration of public water infrastructure has its roots in decades of armed conflict and international sanctions. Tap water has been undrinkable since the 1990s, forcing households to rely on private water vendors. Water infrastructure upgrading was a priority for state-rebuilding after 2003 but receded under the sectarian civil war. Governmental and donor plans for mega-infrastructure water projects have since stalled in the face of systemic corruption and racketeering. Compact water treatment units (CWTUs) remain the dominant purification technology, supplying 83% of treatment capacity across Basra governorate and 92% in Basra city. The efficiency of CWTUs supplying Basra city is restricted by irregular flows from the Bada’a Canal to the key conduit of the R-Zero water treatment plant. These flows are impacted by upstream dam construction, climatic variability and illegal water tapping. The operational capacity of CWTUs is also limited by under-investment in their maintenance, often reducing their working life to 10-15 years.

Due to industrialization a number of different industries have become interested to invest in our country. Some of the industries are discharging their waste water without treatment to the water bodies causing ecological imbalance in aquatic life as a whole. In this study water samples were collected from two industries, manufacturing leather chemicals and kraft paper. A laboratory scale treatability study was conducted to find out an appropriate treatment procedure to achieve a depletion of pollutants - BOD and COD to a level to meet the standard for discharge to surface water bodies. The treatment procedure was standardized and a physicochemical treatment followed by biological treatment and tertiary treatment was found to be more suitable. The dosing rate of chemicals and retention period of biological degradation were fixed. On the basis of the findings the design criteria of individual units of effluent treatment plant was finalized.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/91750417-47eb-4fca-9c97-ae038aec5049/485-496.pdf,pdf
98,Mannose glycosylation is an integral step for human NIS localization and function in breast cancer cells,10.5061/dryad.r7sqv9s7f,"Rathod, Maitreyi, Chatterjee, Sushmita, Dutta, Shruti, Kalraiya, Rajiv, Bhattacharya, Dibyendu, De, Abhijit",2019-10-07,"Chasing an intriguing biological question on the disparity of sodium iodide symporter (NIS or SLC5A5) expression and function in clinical scenario of breast cancer (BC), this study addresses key molecular defects involved. Human NIS expression is primarily recorded as a cytoplasmic protein, thus limiting its scope for targeted radio-iodine therapy. While developing NIS transgene over-expressing MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma, a few unique clonal derivatives show predominant expression in plasma membrane, whereas majority others show cytosolic expression over long passages. The membrane lineage shows un-perturbed dynamic trafficking of NIS through secretory pathway organelles, when compared to cytoplasmic or parental cells. Further, treatment of membrane cells with specific glycosylation inhibitors highlights the importance of inherent glycosylation processing. The 84 gene signature glycosylation RT-Profiler array reveals that membrane clones cluster separately from the rest. Further, role of three differentially expressed genes i.e. MAN1B1, MAN1A1 and MAN2A1 in regulation of NIS localization is confirmed by RNA interference. Thus, for the first time this study shows the important role of mannosidase in N-glycosylation processing for proper trafficking of NIS to the plasma membrane in BC cells",https://zenodo.org/api/files/f4637ebb-fddf-4b37-9575-257fbcc0448f/file_uploaded_in_JCS.xlsx,xlsx
