The nano-scale dimension of NMs, together with other specific physicochemical properties may determine their varying biological effects. The consequent increase of human exposure to NM advises urgency on a proper risk assessment by thorough studies that cover the evaluation of their toxicity.
In the present study, a flow cytometric based approach to evaluate the toxicity of graphene family of nanomaterials (GFNs) to mammalian cells will be presented. Briefly, to evaluate cell-nanoparticles interactions, several cell models were exposed to different concentrations of GFNs and analysed by flow cytometry after 24h or 48h. Endpoints include nanoparticle cell uptake (FSC/SSC), intracellular ROS formation (DCFH2-DA), inflammatory potential by cytokine estimation using cytometric bead arrays, induction of apoptosis using FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit and evaluation of cell cycle dynamics. Flow cytometric analysis provide a rapid and accurate screening of biological responses and, although other non-flow cytometric techniques should be used, (eg microscopy, gene expression, etc), our studies indicate that flow cytometric analysis are an extremely helpful tool for in vitro nanotoxicology studies.",Inconnu,Inconnu

However, the possibility to dynamically control the coupling between the guided light fields and the plasmonic resonances is hindered by the turbidity of light propagation in multimode fibers (MMFs). This pivotal point strongly limits the range of studies that can benefit from nanostructured fiber optics. Fortunately, harnessing the interaction between plasmonic modes on the fiber tip and the full set of guided modes can bring this technology to a next generation progress. Here, the intrinsic wealth of information of guided modes is exploited to spatiotemporally control the plasmonic resonances of the coupled system. This concept is shown by employing dynamic phase modulation to structure both the response of plasmonic MMFs on the plasmonic facet and their response in the corresponding Fourier plane, achieving spatial selective field enhancement and direct control of the probe's work point in the dispersion diagram.

Rasheed",2021-04-01,"The plasmonic material properties of aluminum allow active plasmon resonances extending from the blue color in the visible range to the ultraviolet (UV) region of the spectrum. Whereas Al is usually avoided for applications of plasmonics due to its losses in the infrared spectrum region. In this work, the study of the scatter and absorption of disk nanoantennas (DNAs) using various types of materials Au, Ag, and Al is accomplished by using the CST microwave studio suite simulation. The results showed that Al can offer good plasmonic properties when DNA radius is 25 nm to 125 nm at 20 nm height and working wavelengths longer than 800 nm in the near-infrared (NIR) region. Al produces negative plasmonic features around 800 nm wavelength due to the interband transition in the imaginary part of epsilon. For Au and Ag, the plasmonic characteristics rapidly decayed when the DNA radius was higher than 60 nm, but in contrast, Al offers good plasmonic features at these large dimensions of DNAs. This extended response of Al in UV, visible, and NIR, incorporated with its low cost, natural abundance, low native oxide, and amenability to industrial processes, could make Al an extremely promising plasmonic metal candidate for energy applications.

12,Magnetic control of particle trapping in a hybrid plasmonic nanopore,10.1063/5.0046245,"Maccaferri N, Vavassori P., Garoli D.",2021-05-11,"Plasmonic nanopores are extensively investigated as single molecules detectors. The main limitations in plasmonic nanopore technology are the too fast translocation velocity of the molecule through the pore and the consequent very short analysis times, as well as the possible instabilities due to local heating. An interesting approach to enable longer acquisition times is represented by the ability to stably trap the nanoparticles used to tag molecules close to the nanopore. Here, we theoretically investigate the performance of a magneto-plasmonic nanopore prepared with a thin layer of cobalt sandwiched between two gold layers. A nanopore is then coupled with a bifunctional (magnetic and plasmonic) core–shell nanoparticle made of magnetite (core) covered with a thin layer of gold (shell). By setting the magnetic configuration of the cobalt layer around the pore by an external magnetic field, it is possible to generate a nanoscale magnetic tweezer to trap the nanoparticle at a specific point. Considering a 10nm diameter magnetite nanoparticle, we calculate a trapping force up to 28 pN, an order of magnitude above the force that can be obtained with standard optical or plasmonic trapping approaches. Moreover, the magnetic force pulls the nanoparticle in close contact with the plasmonic nanopore’s wall, thus enabling the formation of a nanocavity enclosing a sub-10nm3 confined
electromagnetic field with an average field intensity enhancement up to 230 at near-infrared wavelengths. The presented hybrid
magneto-plasmonic system points toward a strategy to improve nanopore-based biosensors for single-molecule detection and potentially for the analysis of various biomolecules.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/965564ca-182c-4575-a63f-e7cefa254fbc/2021_apl.pdf,pdf

A milestone in the field has been the development of the so-called seed-mediated growth method, a synthetic route that provided access to an extraordinary diversity of metal nanoparticles with tailored size, geometry and composition. Such a morphological control came along with an exquisite definition of the optical response of plasmonic nanoparticles, thereby increasing their prospects for implementation in various fields. The susceptibility of surface plasmons to respond to small changes in the surrounding medium or to perturb (enhance/quench) optical processes in nearby molecules, has been exploited for a wide range of applications, from biomedicine to energy harvesting. However, the possibilities offered by plasmonic nanoparticles can be expanded even further by their careful assembly into either disordered or ordered structures, in 2D and 3D. The assembly of plasmonic nanoparticles gives rise to coupling/hybridization effects, which are strongly dependent on interparticle spacing and orientation, generating extremely high electric fields (hot spots), confined at interparticle gaps. Thus, the use of plasmonic nanoparticle assemblies as optical sensors have led to improving the limits of detection for a wide variety of (bio)molecules and ions. Importantly, in the case of highly ordered plasmonic arrays, other novel and unique optical effects can be generated. Indeed, new functional materials have been developed via the assembly of nanoparticles into highly ordered architectures, ranging from thin films (2D) to colloidal crystals or supercrystals (3D). The progress in the design and fabrication of 3D supercrystals could pave the way toward next generation plasmonic sensors, photocatalysts, optomagnetic components, metamaterials, etc.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/e981d322-d86d-45d7-89bd-983a17da59a3/ACR_preprint.pdf,pdf

In this context, immobilization of enzymes on plasmonic nanoparticles offers an opportunity to create light-responsive biocatalytic materials. Nevertheless, a fundamental and mechanistic understanding of the effects of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation on enzyme regulation remains elusive. We herein investigate the plasmonic effects on biocatalysis using Au nanospheres (AuNSp) and nanostars (AuNSt) as model plasmonic nanoparticles, lipase from Candida antarctica fraction B (CALB) as a proof-of-concept enzyme, and 808 nm as near-infrared light excitation. Our data show that LSPR excitation enables an enhancement of 58% in the enzyme activity for CALB adsorbed on AuNSt, compared with the dark conditions. This work shows how photothermal heating over the LSPR excitation enhances the CALB activity through favoring product release in the last step of the enzyme mechanism.

Although this effect has been already used to modulate plasmonic resonances in nanophotonics, it has not been fully examined for the two materials chosen in this work — vanadium dioxide (VO2) and iron-rhodium alloy (FeRh). Plasmonic resonances can be described as resonances of electromagnetic field in metallic nanostructures. With these nanostructures we are even able to modulate light. In this thesis, we firstly optimized electron beam lithography process for production of metal nanodiscs with 40–200 nm diameters. Secondly, we measured an optical response of gold nanodiscs to better understand the nature of their plasmonic resonances and interactions between them. Lastly, we described the optimization of polycrystalline VO2 growth and measured optical responses of VO2 and FeRh nanodiscs during their respective phase transitions. Our observation of Mie’s resonances in the dielectric phase of the VO2 nanodiscs suggests, that they have a potential to act as tunable plasmonic resonators which switch from Mie’s resonances in the dielectric phase into plasmonic resonances in the metallic one. When measuring the FeRh nanodiscs, we observed plasmonic resonances in the visible part of the spectrum. These resonances can be used to facilitate FeRh transition from an anti-ferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic phase, as they could lower the required latent heat.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/16d05b24-9639-4d2e-b818-6dcbc462fb74/kepic_bachelor_thesis.pdf,pdf

Specifically, SP‐derived merocyanine (MC) molecules formed by photochemical ring‐opening reaction display efficient ISC due to their zwitterionic character. In contrast, ISC in quinoidal MC molecules formed by thermal ring‐opening reaction is negligible. The high ISC rate can improve fluorescence quantum yield of the plasmon‐modified spontaneous emission, only when the plasmonic electromagnetic field enhancement is sufficiently high. Along this line, extensive photomodulation of fluorescence is demonstrated by switching the ISC in MC molecules at Au nanoparticle aggregates, where strongly enhanced plasmonic hot spots exist.

We introduce a bottom-up approach to build plasmonic substrates using micellar block copolymer nanolithography to generate a 2D array of Au seeds, followed by chemical growth leading to anisotropic nanoparticles. The resulting plasmonic substrates show a broad plasmon band covering a wide part of the visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectral ranges. Both human and murine cells were successfully grown on the substrates. A simple functionalization step of the plasmonic substrates with the cyclic arginylglycylaspartic acid (c-RGD) peptide allowed us to tune the morphology of integrin-rich human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Subsequent irradiation with a NIR laser led to highly efficient detachment of the cells with cell viability confirmed using the MTT assay. We thus propose the use of such plasmonic substrates for cell growth and controlled detachment using remote near-IR irradiation, as a general method for cell culture in biomedical applications. Cell harvesting: Tailored plasmonic substrates can be used to capture various types of cells, which can be further released by irradiation with near-infrared (NIR) light without being damaged.

These plasmonic nanoparticles can respond to their surroundings or even influence the optical processes (for example, absorption, fluorescence and Raman scattering) of molecules located at their surface. As a result, plasmonic nanoparticles have been developed for multiple purposes, ranging from the detection of chemicals and biological molecules to light-harvesting enhancement in solar cells. By dispersing the nanoparticles in polymers and creating a hybrid material, the robustness, responsiveness and flexibility of the system are enhanced while preserving the intrinsic properties of the nanoparticles. In this Review, we discuss the fabrication and applications of plasmonic polymer nanocomposites, focusing on applications in optical data storage, sensing and imaging and photothermal gels for in vivo therapy. Within the nanocomposites, the nanoporosity of the matrix, the overall mechanical stability and the dispersion of the nanoparticles are important parameters for achieving the best performance.

Plasmonic NPs have attracted particular attention due to strong optical, electrical, biological, and catalytic effects they are accompanied with. Surface plasmon resonance characteristics of plasmonic NPs and their assemblies enable fine‐tuning of these effects with unprecedented dynamic range. In turn, the uniquely high polarizability of plasmonic nanostructures and related optical effects exemplified by surface‐enhanced Raman scattering and red–blue color changes give rise to their application to biosensing. Since supramolecular interactions are ubiquitous in nature, scientists have found a spectrum of biomimetic properties of individual and assembled NPs that can be regulated by the layer of surface ligands coating all NPs. This paradigm has given rise to multiple studies from the design of molecular containers and enzyme‐like catalysts to chiroplasmonic assemblies.

Metal nanoparticles have the ability to confine the collective oscillation of electrons, which is called localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). In this work, silver nanoparticles have been proposed to enhance light harvesting, which could be useful for different applications. Metal nanoparticles such as gold and silver nanoparticles have the ability to concentrate field in a very small space. In this study, gold and silver nanoparticles optical response was investigated using frequency domain simulation. The resonance wavelength of gold and silver nanoparticles was about 550 nm and 400 nm, respectively.
Silver nanoparticles showed better LSPR performance than gold nanoparticles. Therefore, silver nanoparticles were chosen for optical field enhancement. Here silver nanoparticles were placed on a silicon substrate for optical field enhancement. To study the effect of size on the optical response of silver nanoparticles, the optical properties of this structure with different silver nanoparticles diameter values were investigated. Silver nanoparticles with 40 nm diameters showed a better optical response. To study the effect of the distance between silver nanoparticles on the optical response, different gap values were put between silver nanoparticles. The gap value of 4 nm showed a better optical response. The obtained results showed that the localized field is strongly dependent on the metal type, size, and space between nanoparticles. In addition, the optical field concentration can be controlled by tuning the size and space between silver nanoparticles. This will support localized field enhancement. The enhanced localized field will increase the field absorption near the surface, which can be beneficial for energy harvesting applications such as solar cells and detectors",https://zenodo.org/api/files/6dbef35d-e428-4578-9182-61c2f11802de/Light%20harvesting%20enhancement%20using%20metal%20nanoparticles.pdf,pdf

Gold nanostructure and silicon carbide dioxide are the components the plasmonic nanoantenna in the bowtie shape. The results showed that the distance between the tumor tissue and the antenna is important to determine the intensity field where the maximum field is 5.9*10 V/m at a distance of 100 nm. The maximum specific absorption rate is 1.92*10 11 W/kg at a similar distance which gives a higher temperature in the tissue of 580 C o . It is concluded that from the obtained results that the near infrared (1064 nm) resonance wavelength is recommended in the treatment of cancer cell by plasmonic bowtie nanoantenna because higher intensity field is generated.

However, the commonly used planar substrates substantially weaken plasmonic resonances because of their polarizability, and, furthermore, a great part of the enhanced near-field is inside the substrate and thus not available for an analyte. In this contribution we report on a way to reduce these undesirable influences of the substrate by fabricating gold nanowires on high pedestals and thus in reduced contact with the substrate. The influence of the height of the pedestal is an important parameter for the plasmonic near-field enhancement, as we show with finite-difference time-domain simulations. Comparing the plasmonic response and the SEIRA activity of the rods prepared by standard electron beam lithography and the rods additionally treated with reactive ion etching to remove the silicon substrate at the hot-spots of the rods reveals not only the change of the plasmonic-resonance spectrum but also interesting differences of the enhanced phonon-polariton signal from the silicon dioxide layer on the silicon substrate and the about 1 order of magnitude stronger vibrational signal enhancement for an adsorbate monolayer.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/f1e41de7-593d-4650-83c7-e00537244df0/ph-2014-00374r.R2_Proof_hi.pdf,pdf

We report the controlled co-crystallization of 23 nm gold nanoparticles and liquid crystal molecules yielding domains made of highly ordered, helical nanofibers, preferentially twisted to the right or to the left within each domain. We confirmed that such micrometer size domains exhibit strong, far-field circular dichroism (CD) signals, even though the bulk material is racemic. We further highlight the potential of the proposed approach to realize chiral plasmonic thin films by using a mechanical chirality discrimination method. Towards this end, we developed a rapid CD imaging technique based on the use of polarized light optical microscopy (POM), which enabled probing the CD-signal with micrometer-scale resolution, despite of linear dichroism and birefringence in the sample.

One of the most problematic areas is that there is still no unambiguous answer to which main copper monosulfide nanoparticles parameters have a decisive effect on their resonance absorption, scattering or electric field enhancement. It is necessary to study the plasmonic properties of copper monosulfide nanoparticles depending on their main parameter, namely the dielectric constant. The principle of dipole equivalence and Mee-Gans theory for the modeling of the optical nanoparticle characteristics is used. It is found that dielectric constant is a crucial parameter determining the resulting optical response of such nanoparticles. The surrounding medium refractive index affects the position and magnitude of the nanoparticles maximum plasmonic absorption. The nonspherical nanoparticles are characterized by two plasmon peaks corresponding to transverse and longitudinal localized surface plasmon resonance if the ratio between the axes is higher than 1.5. The ellipsoidal nanoparticles exhibit higher sensitivity to changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium in comparison to the spherical ones. The obtained research results are primarily the basis for further comprehensive research of plasmonic copper monosulfide nanoparticles for their specialized applications. Second, knowledge of the influence of the nanoparticle dielectric constant on their resulting spectral characteristics allow tuning of the localized surface plasmon resonance peak position in a wide wavelength range, from 500 to 1200 nm, using the nanoparticle synthesis technique. Thus, the material under study is promising for sensor applications in a wide spectral range.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/689624ec-178c-4a39-9404-b11f2eddd492/Study%20of%20plasmonic%20properties%20of%20copper%20monosulfide%20nanoparticles%20depending%20on%20their%20dielectric%20constant.pdf,pdf

Here, we experimentally demonstrate that suitably self-assembled achiral plasmonic nanostructures produce a high degree of enhancement in the optical dichroism observed from chiral molecules placed in their vicinity. Specifically, we identify a near-field enhancement associated with plasmonic hotpots as the mechanism enabling our observation of visible-NIR circular dichroism emanating from small amounts of chiral molecules. Our structures consist of linear arrays of gold nanorods obtained by introducing chiral anionic surfactants, such as modified bile salts, which lead to selective destabilization of a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide coating layer on Au nanorods, thereby promoting a tip-to-tip oriented assembly. The proposed mechanism of plasmonically-enhanced circular dichroism is supported by deriving a simple, yet general theoretical formalism that confirms the observed results, revealing the role of optical hotspots at the gaps of linear tip-to-tip nanorod assemblies as the origin of enhancement in the dichroism from chiral molecules. Importantly, it is the refractive rather than the absorption-mediated chiral response of the molecules that produces dichroism in the visible-NIR plasmonic regime, far from their UV absorption resonances. The observed self-assembly mechanism suggests that chiral analytes not directly interacting with the nanorod surfaces, but just able to induce tip-to-tip aggregation, can be revealed by a CD signature in the plasmonic region, thereby supporting potential applications in ultrasensitive analysis.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/79c44f52-7fd1-4ef8-bb00-85ec2a29b442/MS_AuNR-NaTPC-revised.pdf,pdf

The position of the gold plasmon band in the UV-Visible spectrum depends on the size and shape of gold nanoparticles as well as on the surrounding environment. By adsorbing various chemical entities, or binding them, the gold plasmon band will shift toward longer wavelengths and the shift is proportional to the concentration. Exosomes transport cargoes of molecules and genetic materials to proximal and distal cells. Presently, the standard method for their isolation and quantification from body fluids is by ultracentrifugation, not a practical method to be implemented in a clinical setting. Thus, a versatile and cutting-edge platform is required to selectively detect and isolate exosomes for further analysis at clinical level. The new sensing protocol, instead of antibodies, makes use of a specially synthesized polypeptide (Vn96), to capture and quantify the exosomes from different media, by binding the heat shock proteins from exosomes. The protocol has been established and optimized by using a glass substrate, in order to facilitate the next stage, namely the transfer of the protocol to a microfluidic environment. After each step of the protocol, the UV-Vis spectrum was recorded and the position of gold Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) band was measured. The sensing process was modelled, taking into account the characteristics of the nano-island structure, prepared by thermal convection and annealing. The optimal molar ratios of the most important chemical entities, involved in the detection of exosomes were calculated as well. Indeed, it was found that the results of the sensing process depend on the two major steps: the molar ratios of streptavidin to biotin-PEG-Vn96 and, the final step, the capture of exosomes by the biotin-PEG-Vn96 complex. The microfluidic device designed for sensing of exosomes consists of a glass substrate, sealed by a PDMS layer that contains the channel and a collecting chamber. In the device, the solutions of linker, cross-linker, etc., are pumped over the gold nano-islands and an Ocean Optics spectrometer is used to measure the position of the Au plasmon band at each step of the sensing. The experiments have shown that the shift of the Au LSPR band is proportional to the concentration of exosomes and, thereby, exosomes can be accurately quantified. An important advantage of the method is the ability to discriminate between exosomes having different origins.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/c8681999-0825-4169-993b-302fa443fc8e/10009022.pdf,pdf

These plasmonic supercrystal arrays are deposited on top the monolayers by means of a template-assisted assembly of gold nanospheres with patterned polydimethylsiloxane molds [1]. These supercrystals arrays consist on square arrays of hexagonally packed gold nanoparticles (50 nm of diameter) which exhibit well-defined surface lattice resonance modes that can be tuned from the visible through the near-infrared by simple variation of the lattice parameter. This tunability can be used to enhance the photoluminescence emission of different transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers. So, as proof of concept, the photoluminescence signal of the monolayer MoS2 and MoSe2 can be significantly enhanced up to 5-6-fold coupling the frequency of the surface lattice resonance of the plasmonic supercrystal to the frequency emission of the transition metal dichalcogenides monolayer.

However, to date, the net plasmonic effect on FRET is still under dispute, with experiments showing efficiency enhancement and reduction. This controversy is due to the challenges involved in the precise positioning of FRET pairs in the near field of a metallic nanostructure, as well as in the accurate characterization of the plasmonic impact on the FRET mechanism. Here, we use the DNA origami technique to place a FRET pair 10 nm away from the surface of gold nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 5 to 20 nm. In this configuration, the fluorophores experience only moderate plasmonic quenching. We use the acceptor bleaching approach to extract the FRET rate constant and efficiency on immobilized single FRET pairs based solely on the donor lifetime. This technique does not require a posteriori correction factors neither a priori knowledge of the acceptor quantum yield, and importantly, it is performed in a single spectral channel. Our results allow us to conclude that, despite the plasmon-assisted Purcell enhancement experienced by donor and acceptor partners, the gold nanoparticles in our samples have a negligible effect on the FRET rate, which in turns yields a reduction of the transfer efficiency.",Inconnu,Inconnu

Here, polymorphic gallium (Ga) is demonstrated to be a very promising candidate for adaptive plasmonics and reconfigurable photonics appli- cations. The Ga sp-metal is widely known as a liquid metal at room temperature. In addition to the many other compelling attributes of nanostructured Ga, including minimal oxidation and biocompatibility, its six phases have varying degrees of metallic character, providing a wide gamut of electrical conductivity and optical behavior tunability. Here, the dielectric function of the several Ga phases is introduced and correlated with their respective electronic structures. The key conditions for optimal opti- cal modulation and switching for each Ga phase are eval- uated. Additionally, we provide a comparison of Ga with other more common phase-change materials, showing better performance of Ga at optical frequencies. Further- more, we first report, to the best of our knowledge, the optical properties of liquid Ga in the terahertz (THz) range showing its broad plasmonic tunability from ultraviolet to visible-infrared and down to the THz regime.

The hybrid device is constructed by coupling a doublet of V-shaped gold plasmonic nanoantennas on top of the indium phosphide waveguide. By taking advantage of the localized surface plasmons, our hybrid device can enable detection of the magnetization state in magnetic bits beyond the diffraction limit of light and enhance the polar magneto-optical Kerr effect (PMOKE). We further illustrate how combining the hybrid device with a plasmonic polarization rotator provides magneto-optical read-out by transforming the PMOKE-induced polarization change into an intensity variation of the waveguide mode. According to the simulation results based on a three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method, the hybrid device can detect the magnetization states in targeted bits in a magnetic racetrack medium down to ~100×100 nm 2 , regardless of the magnetization state of the rest of the racetrack with a relative intensity contrast of greater than 0.5% for a ~200×100 nm 2 magnetic bit.

Liz-Marzán",2018-08-14,"Metal colloids are of great interest in the field of nanophotonics, mainly due to their morphology-dependent optical properties, but also because they are high quality building blocks for complex plasmonic architectures. Close-packed colloidal supercrystals not only serve for investigating the rich plasmonic resonances arising in strongly coupled arrangements, but also enables tailoring the optical response, on both the nano- and the macroscale. Bridging these vastly different length scales at reasonable fabrication costs has remained fundamentally challenging, but is essential for applications in sensing, photovoltaics or optoelectronics, among other fields. We present here a scalable approach to engineer plasmonic supercrystal arrays, based on the template-assisted assembly of gold nanospheres with topographically patterned polydimethylsiloxane molds. Regular square arrays of hexagonally packed supercrystals were achieved, reaching periodicities down to 400 nm and feature sizes around 200 nm, over areas up to 0.5 cm2. These two-dimensional supercrystals exhibit well-defined collective plasmon modes that can be tuned from the visible through the near-infrared by simple variation of the lattice parameter. We present electromagnetic modelling of the physical origin of the underlying hybrid modes, and demonstrate the application of superlattice arrays as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy substrates which can be tailored for a specific probe laser. We therefore investigated the influence of the lattice parameter, local degree of order, and cluster architecture, to identify the optimal configuration for highly efficient SERS of a non-resonant Raman probe with 785 nm excitation.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/305ec1e9-310a-467b-a558-56e827b871a9/1875_Superlattices-revised.pdf,pdf

We unambiguously identify a spectral shift of about 8 nm in the CL spectra acquired from both sides and show that this asymmetry is induced by the electron beam itself. By numerical simulations, we confirm the observations and identify the underlying physical effect due to the interference of the CL emission patterns of an electron-beam-induced dipole and the breathing mode.
