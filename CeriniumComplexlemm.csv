Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the progressive neurological diseases that are associated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta of brain. Administration of drugs such as levodopa or dopamine agonists helps to increase dopamine concentration but is impeded by the endothelial layer of blood-brain barrier resulting ineffective treatment. Nanotechnology approaches have created new vistas in order to solve this burning issue. 85 nm PEGylated immunoliposome encapsulated tyrosine hydroxylase expression plasmid effectively crosses blood brain barrier and restores motor behaviour in rat model. Non-viral gene therapy comprising of Lactoferrin modified nanoparticle vectors of size 196±10 nm have gener­ated neuro protective effects. Additionally another agent known as poly-hydroxylated fullerene derivative C60(OH)24 induces positive effect in MPP+ induced PD model with its free radical scavenging activity and antioxidant potential. Equally reveal­ing is the information about smart material namely cerium oxide nanoparticle or nanoceria as a ROS scavenger to decrease oxidative stress. In this review, attempt has been made to evaluate the role of nanotechnology for the remediation of PD.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/b4798f78-8929-4e94-ae05-9a03c5211bd2/August-13.pdf,pdf,"Department of Bitechnology , Haldia Insitute of Technology , ICARE Complex , Haldia-721 657 , Purba Midnapore ,

The reaction between cerium(IV) and N-(2-hydroxyethyl)phthalimide (NHEP) is very slow in sulphuric acid medium at 25 ºC. However, the reaction is facile in presence of ethylenediamminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in aqueous sulphuric acid medium. The reaction between cerium(IV) and NHEP in presence of EDTA exhibits 1 : 1 (oxidant : reductant) stoichiometry. The products are identified as cerium(III)-EDTA complex, n-methylphthalimide and formaldehyde. The order with respect to oxidant concentration is unity, whereas the order with respect to both substrate and catalyst concentration is less than unity. Increase in sulphuric acid concentration increases the rate of reaction. The order with respect to H+ ion concentration is less than unity. The added product cerium(III), did not have any significant effect on the rate of reaction in presence of EDTA. The active species of oxidant is identified as CeSO42+. Based on the experimental results a suitable mechanism is proposed.

Oxidation of 2-phenyl ethanol and 2-methyl cyclohexanol by cerium(IV) sulphate in aqueous sulphuric acid medium is greatly enhanced by iridium(III) chloride. Catalyst combines with the complex formed between cerium(Iv) and organic substrate and ultimately gives rise to corresponding aromatic dicarboxylic acids as the product of oxidation. Reactions follows direct proportionality with respect to catalyst concentrations while the first order kinetics shown by the oxidant and organic substrate at their low concentrations become zero order at higher concentrations of both oxidant and organic substrate. Rate decreased with increasing concentrations of H+ ions. Externally added CeIII and Cl- ions have negative effects on the reaction rate. Stoichiometry of the reaction was determined and the final oxidation products were identified to be 2-phenyl ethanoic acid and 2-methyl hexane-1,6-dioic acid respectively for 2-phenyl ethanol and 2- methyl cyclohexanol.

The formation energies determined by ab initio calculations of different defects and atomic chemical potentials in YAG:Ce,C are discussed in O-poor and O-rich conditions corresponding to the crystal growth under Ar+CO reducing atmosphere, and post-growth annealing in air. It is shown that as-grown crystals contain numerous positively charged defects responsible for F-type center formation, whereas mainly negative charged defects are remained after the annealing in air. The negatively charged defects located nearby Ce luminescence center occupying Y site may stabilize cerium in the tetravalent state and promote a hole transport to this luminescence center. This describes a high scintillation efficiency of Ce,C-doped garnets. Furthermore, YAG:C and YAG:Ce,C with a high carbon concentration, besides of luminescence peaked at 400 ns ascribed to F+-type centers, possess a fast luminescence peaked around 650 nm that may be attributed to the complex defect centers. These unveiled features of the luminescence process in rare-earth garnets may contribute to the development of efficient luminescence materials.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/8b916dc5-1bd5-48c5-8ec4-4d9949ad580b/pss%20b%20zenodo.pdf,pdf,"Ce - dope yttrium aluminum garnet ( YAG ) be among the efficient rare - earth garnet scintillator and phosphor . this paper address a computational and experimental study of complex f - type defect center form in YAG by dope with cerium and carbon . the formation energy determine by ab initio calculation of different defect and atomic chemical potential in YAG : Ce , C be discuss in o - poor and o - rich condition correspond to the crystal growth under ar+co reduce atmosphere , and post - growth anneal in air . it be show that as - grow crystal contain numerous positively charge defect responsible for f - type center formation , whereas mainly negative charge defect be remain after the annealing in air . the negatively charge defect locate nearby Ce luminescence center occupy Y site may stabilize cerium in the tetravalent state and promote a hole transport to this luminescence center . this describe a high scintillation efficiency of Ce , c - dope garnet . furthermore , YAG : C and YAG : Ce , c with a high carbon concentration , besides of luminescence peak at 400 ns ascribe to f+-type center , possess a fast luminescence peak around 650 nm that may be attribute to the complex defect center . these unveil feature of the luminescence process in rare - earth garnet may contribute to the development of efficient luminescence material ."

Initially dendrimer protected-nanoscale silver particles have been synthesized in aqueous medium. UV-Vis spectra and transmission electron micrograph indicate almost spherical silver particles with an average diameter 6 ± 2 nm were formed. The preformed dendrimer protected silver nanoparticle solution was mixed with DNA solution to fabricate the dendrimer/DNA complex. At the dendrimer/DNA-mixing ratio (number ratio of NH2 groups in dendrimer vs phosphate groups in DNA) 0.3, aggregates (nanogel) were formed. Transmission micrograph revealed the presence of silver nanoparticles inside that gel matrix. Binding of dendrimer molecule with DNA chain occurs through electrostatic interaction.

The oxidation of succinic acid by cerium(IV) has been studied spectrophotometrically in aqueous sulphuric acid medium at 298 K at constant ionic strength or 1.6 mol dm-3. A minute amount or ruthenium(lll) (10-6 mol dm-3) is sumcient to enhance the slow reaction between succinic acid and cerium(JV). The main reaction products are cerium(lll) and oxaloacetic acid. The stoichiometry is 1 : 4, that is[sue.acid] : [CeIV] == 1 : 4. The reaction is first order in both cerium(IV) and ruthnium(lll) concentrations. The order with respect to sue. acid concentration varies from first order to zero order, as the succinic acid concentration increases. Increase in sulphuric acid concentration decreases the reaction rate. The added sulphate and bisulpahte decreases the rate or reaction. The added product cerium(lll) retards the reaction rate.

A minute (10-8 mol dm-3) quantity of iodide mediated oxidation of arsenic(III) by cerium(IV) in an aqueous sulphuric acid and sulphate media has been studied spectrophotometrically at 25 °C. The stoichiometry is 1 : 2, i.e. one mole of arsenic(lll) requires two moles of cerium(IV). The reaction is first order each in cerium(IV) and iodide concentrations. The order with respect to arsenic(lll) is less than unity. Increase in sulphuric acid concentration increased the rate. In situ H+ ion concentration is calculated by the knowledge of equilibrium constants and the order with respect to H+ ion concentration is found to be less than unity. The ionic strength did not have any significant effect on the rate of reaction, whereas rate constant increased with decreasing dielectric constant of the medium. Added products cerium(lll) and arsenic(V) did not have any significant effect on the reaction rate. The active species of oxidant and reductant are Ce(SO4)2+ and Asl2+ respectively. A suitable mechanism is proposed. The catalytic constant and activation parameters are determined. The.results obtained in the present study are similar to that of bromide, chloride and iodide mediated oxidation of antimony(III) by cerium(IV) in aqueous sulphuric acid-sulfate media and are compared and discussed.

All synthesis technologies used are complex. The structural phase of yttrium-aluminum garnet is formed with any technology, at temperatures exceeding 1,500 °C. The starting materials for the synthesis are metal oxides of aluminum, yttrium and other oxides for activation and modification. It seems possible to use hard radiation to form a new phase. Radiation synthesis of ceramics is realized in less than 1 s, without the use of any additives and influences.
The synthesis was carried out at the electron accelerator of the Institute of Nuclear Physics (Novosibirsk). In this work, we studied the spectral-kinetic and quantitative characteristics of luminescence for the first time obtained by the method of radiation synthesis of ceramic samples of yttrium-aluminum garnet doped with cerium with statistical processing of their values. The dependences of the reproducibility of the spectral characteristics of the luminescence of the samples on the preliminary preparation of the charge for synthesis have been investigated. Several cycles of luminophore brightness studies have been performed.
It is shown that the obtained ceramics based on yttrium-aluminum garnet doped with cerium possesses the required spectral-kinetic properties, and the efficiency of conversion of the chip radiation into luminescence is achieved, which is comparable to that available in commercial phosphors.

To this aim, a controllable 3D cell culture model which spans nearly 1 cm(2) in surface footprint is designed. This structure is composed of fibroblasts containing SERS-encoded nanoparticles (i.e., SERS tags), arranged in an alternating layered structure. This ""sandwich"" type structure allows monitoring of the SERS signals in the z-axis and with mm dimensions in the xy-axis. Taking advantage of correlative microscopy techniques such as electron microscopy, it is possible to corroborate nanoparticle positioning and distances in z-depths of up to 150 mu m.

However, in the former time, polyethylene glycol (PEG) was connected into phospholipid after the liposomes were already prepared. In this paper, we intend to study the possibility of applying phospholipids which already connected with PEG and then they were used to prepare liposomes. The model drug resveratrol was used because it can be applied against different diseases. Cholesterol was applied to stabilize the membrane of liposomes. The thin film technique in a laboratory scale was a preparation method. The liposomes were then characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) and light microscopic techniques. The stable liposomes can be produced and the particle sizes after filtration were in nanometers. The 2- and 3-chains-PEG-phospholipid (PL) caused in smaller particle size than the 4-chains-PEG-PL. Liposomes from PL 90G and cholesterol were stable during storage at 8 °C of 56 days because the particle sizes measured by PCS were almost not changed. There was almost no leakage of resveratrol from liposomes PL 90G with cholesterol after diffusion test in dialysis tube for 28 days. All liposomes showed the sustained release during measuring time of 270 min. The maximum release amount of 16-20% was detected with liposomes from 2- and 3-chains-PEG-PL.

Pre-sowing seed priming is a promising strategy to provide value-added solutions that influence the yield and quality of the seed. For selecting the appropriate doses of Ag-nanoparticle and GA3, three doses were taken for each chemical and eight genotypes of green gram were selected. The doses of Ag-nanoparticle were 10 ppm, 20 ppm and 50 ppm and for GA3 50 ppm, 100 ppm, 150 ppm. Eight genotypes of green gram were soaked with three doses each of GA3 and Ag-nanoparticle solution for 6 hours. The laboratory experiment was conducted in seed testing laboratory, BCKV, West Bengal during 2019. Germination percentage and vigor were observed to determine the changes in seed quality after priming with different doses GA3 and Ag-Nanoparticle. While considering treatments over genotypes for GA3, significantly highest germination percentage (99.16) and vigour index (2017.937) were observed when it was primed with 50 ppm GA3. In case of Ag-nanoparticle significantly highest germination percentage (99.31) and vigour index (2102.632) were recorded for 20 ppm, when the average was made over genotypes. So, Ag-Nanoparticle @ 20 ppm and GA3 @ 50 ppm were proved to be appropriate dose in green gram for quality seed production.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/5073a113-83cb-49d0-99a1-3fbbdf9b3b08/IJOEAR-APR-2021-7.pdf,pdf,"abstract — one of the most important pulse crop in India be green gram ( Vigna radiata L. ) . pre - sowing seed priming be a promising strategy to provide value - add solution that influence the yield and quality of the seed . for select the appropriate dose of Ag - nanoparticle and GA3 , three dose be take for each chemical and eight genotype of green gram be select . the dose of Ag - nanoparticle be 10 ppm , 20 ppm and 50 ppm and for GA3 50 ppm , 100 ppm , 150 ppm . eight genotype of green gram be soak with three dose each of GA3 and Ag - nanoparticle solution for 6 hour . the laboratory experiment be conduct in seed testing laboratory , BCKV , West Bengal during 2019 . germination percentage and vigor be observe to determine the change in seed quality after prime with different dose GA3 and Ag - Nanoparticle . while consider treatment over genotype for GA3 , significantly high germination percentage ( 99.16 ) and vigour index ( 2017.937 ) be observe when it be prime with 50 ppm GA3 . in case of Ag - nanoparticle significantly high germination percentage ( 99.31 ) and vigour index ( 2102.632 ) be record for 20 ppm , when the average be make over genotype . so , Ag - Nanoparticle @ 20 ppm and GA3 @ 50 ppm be prove to be appropriate dose in green gram for quality seed production ."
