It was shown that changes in chemical composition of the materials lead to the evolution of crystal structure, morphology, and magnetic properties. The thermal behavior of precursor gel was investigated by thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) measurements. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis demonstrated that all samples were monophasic. The Rietveld analysis showed that the structure can be indexed by trigonal or cubic unit cell depending on Bi3+ content. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to evaluate morphological features of the synthesized materials and revealed that Bi3+ ions significantly promote growth of the grains. The sol–gel-derived BixLa1−xMnO3+δ specimens were also characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy and magnetization measurements, which showed a clear correlation between magnetic properties and crystal structure of the materials.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/71902e83-1668-40b3-9036-a6e6d7e5b8d9/Novel%20synthetic%20approach%20to%20the%20preparation%20of%20single-phase%20BixLa1%E2%88%92xMnO3%2B%CE%B4%20solid%20solutions.pdf,pdf

Sodium alginate sol can be converted into ionotropic gel through the diffusion of a di- or trivalent metal ion. The kinetics or this process can be studied by two different methods. The first is the analytical method in which the decrease of the divalent metal ion concentration with time during the exchange process with sodium alginate sol is followed complexometrically. It is found that the rate of gel formation is greater at first during the primary gel membrane formation, and it depends on both the electrolyte and the sol concentration. The rate then decreases during the further gel growth and becomes constant whatever the concentration or the electrolyte is. This may be attributed to the diffusion control through the primary gel membrane. The second method is the drop density method in which the rate of density variation or a sol drop during its contact with the electrolyte solution is taken as a measure or ionotropic gel growth. The drop density method is carried out at different temperatures, and the rate of growth is found to increase by raising temperature. The activation energy is calculated and found to have the values between (13-20 k.j./Mole).",https://zenodo.org/api/files/423cd866-0912-4025-b60d-89969e9130b8/728-731.pdf,pdf

Mesoporous carbon xerogels were synthesised using paraformaldehyde and resorcinol as precursors. Organic gel was obtained by sol-gel processing of the precursors. The wet gel was dried and then carbonized under nitrogen flow to obtain carbon xerogel. A series of carbon xerogels was synthesised by varying pH of sol-gel processing in the range of 5.5 to 6.3. One carbon xerogel was activated by nitric acid and subsequently heated at elevated temperatures (200 to 300ºC) under vacuum to obtain another series of carbon xerogels. All the carbon xerogels were characterised by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm measurement. The carbon xerogels were found to be significantly mesoporous. Pore texture was found to be tuned by the precursor sol-gel processing pH as well as by the post synthesis treatment by means of nitric acid activation-evacuation at elevated temperature.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/6ed763ac-8b9f-475a-a408-244ae77b1af6/May-6.pdf,pdf

The aim of the work was to achieve an effective control of the nanostructure properties and morphology of the final g-Al2O3. The influence of the reagent temperature during the hydrolysis was evaluated in case of water at 5 ºC and 98 ºC, and alkoxide at -18 ºC and room temperature. Sol-gel transitions were performed at 120 ºC and room temperature. All g-Al2O3 samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption and thermal analysis. Our results showed that temperature of both water and alkoxide has not much influence on the nanostructure of the final g-Al2O3, thus giving a structure very similar to that of samples obtained by the reference method as long as the reaction temperature above 75 ºC is reached soon enough. XRD characterization showed diffraction patterns corresponding to g-Al2O3 for all samples. Also BET specific area values (253-280 m2/g) were similar to those obtained by Yoldas’s original method. The temperature of the sol-gel transition does not affect the resulting sample structure, and crystalline boehmite particles were identified in all dried gels. We analyzed the reproducibility of the samples’ structure by preparing different samples under identical conditions; we found that performing the sol-gel transition at 120 ºC favors the production of more reproducible samples and also reduces significantly the time of the sol-gel reaction.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/0206301a-46b7-4982-bd3a-8c6fbf9ca308/10004662.pdf,pdf

The aim of this research is to find out the quality of the thin film based on the number of cycles (3, 4, 5, and 6 cycles) and annealing temperature (300, 400 and 500 °C). The variation of annealing temperature and number of cycles can affect the crystal structure of the FTO thin film, crystal size and grain size. Increasing the number of cycles and annealing temperature can lead to larger crystallite size and lower dislocation density, so that electrons between the grains can move easily. The large grain can reduce the grain boundary, increasing the electron mobility and decreasing the resistivity. XRD analysis shows that the structure of SnO2 polycrystalline with the most dominant crystal plane (110) is formed in this research when compared to the intensity of other structures. The resistivity value decreases with increasing the annealing temperature and number of cycles. In addition, transparency value also decreases along with increasing the annealing temperature and number of cycles. The optimum results of resistivity and transparency values obtained in this research are 1.692´10-2 Ω×cm and 69.232 % at 500 °C and 5 cycles.

Factors effecting hydrolysis reaction such as effect of RHA calcination temperature and method used to synthesis the catalyst were investigated. The RHA-MH1200 synthesised via cross-linking and sol-gel methods (using RHA calcined at 1200°C) shows the shortest time taken (5.64 min and 11.18 min, respectively) to produce 40 mL of H2 gas as compared to RHA-MH600 (i.e. 10.47 min and 13.18 min respectively, for both methods using RHA calcined at 600°C).

Glass-forming ability and structural features of melt-quenched and gel-derived SiO2-TiO2 glasses
Abstract
SiO2-TiO2 glasses produced by melt-quenching or sol-gel spray-drying were compared to highlight their structural differences. Glass formation was possible by melt-quenching up to 10 mol% TiO2, while higher contents led to devitrification. Raman spectroscopy and solid-state 17O and 29Si MAS NMR confirmed the clear emergence of Ti-O-Si bonds and a tetrahedral oxygen coordination of Ti4+ leading to full network connectivity, as also substantiated by the synthesis of TiO2-doped cristobalite. In gel-derived glasses, water content induced partial network depolymerization, thereby enhancing the solubility of TiO2 in the hydrous silicate matrix. However, full dehydration during heating proved challenging due to the competing devitrification tendency: the glass-forming range in the anhydrous binary SiO2-TiO2 system does not therefore appear to be significantly enlarged by the sol-gel synthesis route.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/eea7fbcb-fdfb-4cd8-bc2f-52d7c0d35650/Research%20Data%2C%20GCA%20SiO2-TiO2%20glasses.zip,zip

Vesali Naseh",2009-01-21,"In this study, a low temperature sensor highly selective to CO in presence of methane is fabricated by using 4 nm SnO2 quantum dots (QDs) prepared by sonication assisted precipitation. SnCl4 aqueous solution was precipitated by ammonia under sonication, which continued for 2 h. A part of the sample was then dried and calcined at 400°C for 1.5 h and characterized by XRD and BET. The average particle size and the specific surface area of the SnO2 QDs as well as their sensing properties were compared with the SnO2 nano-particles which were prepared by conventional sol-gel method. The BET surface area of sonochemically as-prepared product and the one calcined at 400°C after 1.5 hr are 257 m2/gr and 212 m2/gr respectively while the specific surface area for SnO2 nanoparticles prepared by conventional sol-gel method is about 80m2/gr. XRD spectra revealed pure crystalline phase of SnO2 is formed for both as-prepared and calcined samples of SnO2 QDs. However, for the sample prepared by sol-gel method and calcined at 400°C SnO crystals are detected along with those of SnO2. Quantum dots of SnO2 show exceedingly high sensitivity to CO with different concentrations of 100, 300 and 1000 ppm in whole range of temperature (25- 350°C). At 50°C a sensitivity of 27 was obtained for 1000 ppm CO, which increases to a maximum of 147 when the temperature rises to 225°C and then drops off while the maximum sensitivity for the SnO2 sample prepared by the sol-gel method was obtained at 300°C with the amount of 47.2.

Sol-gel silica glass has a significant effect on the microstructural and mechanical development of the implant materials. Sol-gel method is a versatile method to develop different types of oxide coatings on a large, curved substrates with high homogeneity and low sintering temperatures. In order to enhance the corrosion resistance behavior various types of oxide based, hybrid coatings have been studied. There are a number of interesting studies including the biological functions; biomineralisation with excellent bioactive ability and mechanical strength makes it suitable for biomedical applications. The aim of the work is to enhance the corrosion resistive behavior of the coatings using different strategies such as EPD method, spin coating and biomimetic coating. Silica glass is prepared at a molar ratio of H2O/TEOS (Tetra Ethyl Ortho Silicate) and the obtained powder was characterized by FT-IR, XRD and SEM analysis. It was found that the sol-gel spin coatings have shown excellent thermal stability, oxidation control and enhanced corrosion resistance on metal substrates. The ability to passivate the metal substrates during coating has pronounced effect on corrosion resistance. The corrosion resistance behavior of the coatings was determined by (1) open-circuit potential versus time of exposure, (2) electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, (3) cyclic polarization in Ringer’s solution.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/9d0f1ba8-6a36-4f61-9ef2-45ea1dc70c72/687-690.pdf,pdf

Roelants, Wim Soetaert, Niki Baccile",2022-06-13,"Self-assembled fibrillar network (SAFIN) hydrogels and organogels are commonly obtained by a crystallization process into fibers induced by external stimuli like temperature or pH. The gel-to-sol-to-gel transition is generally readily reversible and the change rate of the stimulus determines the fiber homogeneity and eventual elastic properties of the gels. However, recent work shows that in some specific cases, fibrillation occurs for a given molecular conformation and the sol-to-gel transition depends on the relative energetic stability of one conformation over the other, and not on the rate of change of the stimuli. We observe such a phenomenon on a class of bolaform glycolipids, sophorosides, similar to the well-known sophorolipid biosurfactants, but composed of two symmetric sophorose units. A combination of oscillatory rheology, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and in situ rheo-SAXS using synchrotron radiation shows that below 14°C, twisted nanofibers are the thermodynamic phase. Between 14°C and about 33°C, nanofibers coexist with micelles and a strong hydrogel forms, the sol-to-gel transition being readily reversible in this temperature range. However, above the annealing temperature of about 40°C, the micelle morphology becomes kinetically-trapped over hours, even upon cooling, whichever the rate, to 4°C. A combination of solution and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) suggests two different conformations of the 1ˈˈ, 1ˈ and 2ˈ carbon stereocenters of sophorose, precisely at the β(1,2) glycosidic bond, for which several combinations of the dihedral angles are known to provide at least three energetic minima of comparable magnitude and each corresponding to a given sophorose conformation.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/fcb79b97-bdee-4226-875d-6fa8e31e3b8a/Figures.pptx,pptx

that Eu3+ ions are incorporated in the NaGdF4 NCs. Furthermore, efficient Gd3+→Eu3+ energy transfer results in an enhancement of the reddish Eu3+ emissions,
further supported by fluorescence decay lifetimes.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/3d7af958-fad3-48c9-8d4d-9862deb8f71c/13_Velazquez_2019_JNCS_Novel%20sol-gel%20SiO2-NaGdF4%20transparent%20nano-glass-ceramics.pdf,pdf

Manuscript received 13 September 1993
The synthesis of bimetallic alkoxides has been followed by the preparation of intriguingly stable heterometal alkoxides containing three or four different metal atoms in the same molecular species, which has led to the possibility of molecularly designing a single source precursor suited to the composition of the targeted final ceramic. This has been made feasible by the extraordinary stability of the framework of heterometal alkoxides, which appears to remain intact during the initial hydrolysis reactions in the S-G process. The characterisation (by sophisticated physicochemical techniques including X-Ray crystal structure elucidation in some cases) of heterometal alkoxides appears to have added a new dimension to heterometal coordination systems which appear to be uniquely stable without the presence of metal-metal bonds or auxiliary ligands like CO, etc., enerally required for stabilising polymetallic systems known so far.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/13e62c80-2c02-409e-a6c0-8f765254e7a6/315-321.pdf,pdf

Vilatela, Víctor A. de la Peña O'Shea",2016-04-18,"In this research work, the gas phase CO2 photocatalytic reduction using water as electron donor has been performed using hierarchical assemblies of mesoporous TiO2 1-D nanofibres synthesised by a combination of electrospinning and sol–gel methods. In order to compare the effect of the crystallisation step on oxygen vacancies and conductivity, two different annealing conditions have been undertaken: under a high Ar flow (“TiO2 Fibres-A” sample) and under static Ar (“TiO2 Fibres B” sample). Moreover, these materials have been compared with individualised TiO2 nanoparticles prepared by a sol-gel procedure. CO and H2 are detected as major products with all photocatalysts, with lower amounts of CH4 and CH3OH. The TiO2 nanofibres exhibit better results than the sol-gel photocatalyst, behaviour that may be ascribed to an improved nanocrystals connection, which favours a fast charge transport along the grain boundaries, as measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The highest CO2 reduction activity is achieved with the TiO2 Fibres B catalyst, which gives rise to ca. 4 and 2.5 times higher H2 and CO production, respectively, than the TiO2 Fibres-A one. This sample is composed of a mixture of anatase and rutile crystalline phases (80:20), leading to a decrease in the electron-hole recombination rate observed by photoluminescence (PL) measurements.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/e660baa3-f527-41b2-a709-98f61cfe3699/1._ELSEVIER_JCO_FINAL.pdf,pdf
51,Silicon Esters,10.5281/zenodo.3771732,"Arkles, Barry",1997-01-01,"Silicon esters are silicon compounds that contain an oxygen bridge from silicon to an organic group, ie, Si–OR. The most prevalent is tetraethoxysilane. The applications for tetraalkoxysilanes are classified roughly by whether the Si–OR bond is expected to remain intact or be hydrolyzed in the final application. Applications in which the Si–OR bond is hydrolyzed include as binders for foundry-mold sands used in investment and thin-shell castings; as binders for refractories; and as resins, coatings, sol–gel glasses, cross-linking agents, and adhesion promoters. Applications in which the Si–OR bond remains intact include as heat-transfer and hydraulic fluids. The hydrolysis reaction, which yields polymers of silicic acid that can be dehydrated to silicon dioxide, is of considerable commercial importance. The chemistry and properties of alkoxysilanes and related acyloxysilanes and aspects of commercial production and utilization are reviewed. Sol–gel technology is discussed.

With dialysis the iron content has been found to decrease. but silica content remains practically constant, whilst the impurity as chloride attains a value beyond which further dialysis causes the gelation of the sol within the parchment bag.
The sol has a tendency to yield gels simply by prolonged dialysis, coagulation with suitable amounts of electrolytes, or by simply warming at a certain stage of parity. The results are significant for the measurements of the rate of flow through capillary where it is definitely shown that when the sol begins to deviate from the Poiseulle's law for fluids, either for its concentration or purity, it yields gels.

nitrates and rhenium carbonyls have been used as seeds and they
have been added to the sol specimens in amount of 0.1-0.2% (mas)
calculated on metals. Annealing of obtained gels is carried out at 70–
1100ºC for 2 hrs. The same specimen transforms in α-Al2O3 at
1100ºC. At this temperature in case of presence of lanthanum and
gadolinium transformation takes place by 70-85%. In case of

The as-prepared Ti(OH)4 precipitate was annealed at 800°C to obtain TiO2 nanoparticles. The thermal, structural, morphological and textural characterizations of the TiO2 nanoparticle samples were carried out by different techniques such as DSC-TGA, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy (FTIR), Micro Raman spectroscopy, UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and Field Effect Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) techniques. The as-prepared precipitate was characterized using DSC-TGA and confirmed the mass loss of around 30%. XRD results exhibited no diffraction peaks attributable to anatase phase, for the reaction products, after the solvent removal. The results indicate that the product is purely rutile. The vibrational frequencies of two main absorption bands of prepared samples are discussed from the results of the FTIR analysis. The formation of nanosphere of diameter of the order of 10 nm, has been confirmed by FESEM. The optical band gap was found by using UV-Visible spectrum. From photoluminescence spectra, a strong emission was observed. The obtained results suggest that this method provides a simple, efficient and versatile technique for preparing TiO2 nanoparticles and it has the potential to be applied to other systems for photocatalytic activity.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/10c478af-445a-4bcb-99b2-82601b26cff7/10004347.pdf,pdf

                    Background: Micro-texturing is an increasingly used technique that aims at improving the functional behaviour of components during their useful life, and it is applied in different industrial manufacturing processes for different purposes, such as reducing friction on dynamic rubber seals for pneumatic equipment, among others. Micro-texturing is produced on polymer components by transfer from the mould and might critically increase the adhesion and friction between the moulded rubber part with the mould, provoking issues during demoulding, both on the mould itself and on the rubber part. The mould design, the coating release agent applied to the mould surface, and the operational parameters of the moulding/demoulding process, are fundamental aspects to avoid problems and guarantee a correct texture transfer during the demoulding process. 
                    Methods: In this work, the lack of knowledge about demoulding processes was addressed with an in-house test rig and a robust experimental procedure to measure demoulding forces (DFs) as well as the final quality of the moulded part, between thermoset polymers and moulds. After the characterization of several Sol-Gel coating formulations (inorganic; hybrid) the influence of several parameters was analysed experimentally, i.e.: Sol-Gel efficiency, texture effects, pattern geometry, roughness and material compound. 
                    Results: The results obtained from the experimental studies revealed that texture depth is the most critical geometrical parameter, showing high scatter among the selected compounds. Finally, the experimental results were used to compute a model through reduced order modelling (ROM) technique for the prediction of DFs. 
                    Conclusions: The characterization of DFs in a laboratory, with a specific device operated by a universal testing machine (UTM), provided valuable information that allows a fast and optimized introduction of texturing in rubber components. Selection of a novel Sol-Gel coating and the use of the ROM technique contributed to speed up implementation for mass production.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/2eea77fc-e4ba-4bd9-bdda-29c17bc3f36b/openreseurope-1-14790.pdf,pdf

Nanocrystalline thin films are deposited from various sols. The
effect ZnO sols aging time on the structural and photocatalytic
properties of the films is studied. The films surface is studied by
Scanning Electron Microscopy. The effect of the aging time of the
starting solution is studied in the photocatalytic degradation of
Reactive Black 5 (RB5) by UV-vis spectroscopy. The experiments
are conducted upon UV-light illumination and in complete darkness.
The variation of the absorption spectra shows the degradation of RB5
dissolved in water, as a result of the reaction, occurring on the surface
of the films and promoted by UV irradiation. The initial
concentrations of dye (5, 10 and 20 ppm) and the effect of the aging
time are varied during the experiments. The results show, that the
increasing aging time of starting solution with respect to ZnO
generally promotes photocatalytic activity. The thin films obtained
from ZnO sol, which is aged 30 days have best photocatalytic
degradation of the dye (97,22%) in comparison with the freshly

By heat treatment at 1000–1100 °C, ultrafine carbon powders were obtained. The properties of primary ultrafine carbon powders and their annealing products were studied using a Tescan Vega 3 SEM scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results show that the starting materials affect the structure of the resulting ultrafine carbon powders.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/f6d60be3-6829-4c8c-bc10-f18264e6c617/%D0%96%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%88%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%20%D0%9D.%20%D0%A2.%20.pdf,pdf

J.",1988-03-01,"The hydrolysis and condensation reactions of monomeric alkoxysilanes and organylalkoxysilanes utilized in sol-gel processing are reviewed. Both reactions occur by acid or base-catalyzed bimolecular displacement reactions. The acid-catalyzed mechanisms are preceded by protonation of OH or OR substituents attached to Si, whereas under basic conditions hydroxyl or silanolate anions attack Si directly. Many of the observed structural trends are understood on the basis of the pH and [H2O] dependence of the hydrolysis, condensation, and dissolution reactions.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/613c5603-4f6b-45da-acd2-3e7c73068d65/article.pdf,pdf

development of quasi-two-dimensional niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5)
as a semiconductor for the potential electronic applications such as
capacitors, filtration, dye-sensitised solar cells and gas sensing
platforms. Therefore once the purpose is established, Nb2O5 can be
prepared in a number of nano- and sub-micron-structural
morphologies that include rods, wires, belts and tubes. In this study
films of Nb2O5 were prepared on gold plated silicon substrate using
spin-coating technique and subsequently by mechanical exfoliation.
The reason this method was employed was to achieve layers of less
than 15nm in thickness. The sintering temperature of the specimen
was 800oC. The morphology and structural characteristics of the
films were analyzed by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Raman
Spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS).",https://zenodo.org/api/files/981d27de-eb09-4ee0-9c9a-7cbe7e851889/1752.pdf,pdf
