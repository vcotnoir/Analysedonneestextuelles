0,Hydrogen Generation by Accelerating Aluminum Corrosion in Water with Alumina,10.5281/zenodo.1061180,"J. Skrovan, A. Alfantazi, T. Troczynski",2011-07-22,"For relatively small particles of aluminum (<60 μm),
a measurable percentage of the aluminum (>5%) is observed to
corrode before passivation occurs at moderate temperatures (>50oC)
in de-ionized water within one hour. Physical contact with alumina
powder results in a significant increase in both the rate of corrosion
and the extent of corrosion before passivation. Whereas the resulting
release of hydrogen gas could be of commercial interest for portable
hydrogen supply systems, the fundamental aspects of Al corrosion
acceleration in presence of dispersed alumina particles are equally
important. This paper investigates the effects of various amounts of
alumina on the corrosion rate of aluminum powders in water and the
effect of multiple additions of aluminum into a single reactor.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/f68d4c4c-4d1a-4ab3-a360-4e586d0c6c09/5508.pdf,pdf
1,INFLUENCE OF THE PARAMETERS OF THE STRUCTURE OF METALLIC MATERIALS ON THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MINING MACHINE PARTS,10.5281/zenodo.5901678,"Apakashev Rafail, Khazin Mark",2021-12-30,"To improve the reliability and durability of mining equipment, it is promising to use micro- and nanostructured metals and alloys, as well as metal-matrix composites. Ordinary and nanostructured samples of aluminum, copper, bronze C95200, an aluminum-magnesium alloy 518.0, and an aluminum-matrix dispersion-reinforced composite containing 6.3 wt% titanium were studied. Structuring processing of metallic materials was carried out in the liquid phase state. The aluminum-matrix composite was synthesized by powder metallurgy. A model electrolyte solution, containing 30 g / L NaCl and an addition of acetic acid to pH = 4.0, was used as a corrosive medium. Corrosion resistance test base was 144 hours, temperature + 22 ° C, the volume of the solution in the cell with three samples was 500 ml. The relative calculated test error was 5%. A continuous uniform distribution of corrosion damage to the metal surface is observed for all studied samples. In this case, the corrosion rate (П, mm / year) of nanostructured metals and alloys samples is approximately 11% less than the corrosion rate of the same metals and alloys samples that have not undergone structuring treatment. For the aluminum matrix composite, it was noted that the dispersed reinforcement of aluminum with titanium provides an increase in the corrosion resistance of the matrix metal by 9.6%. The results of the conducted studies indicate an increased corrosion resistance of nanostructured metallic materials and an aluminum-matrix composite, which is important when they are used as part of equipment operated in a corrosive environment.",Inconnu,Inconnu

The corrosion behavior of base metal (Al-6061) and Al/ZrO2 nanocomposite in seawater (3.5% NaCl solution) is measured using the potential control method. The corrosion rate is evaluated by Tafel extrapolation technique. The corrosion potential increases with the increase in wt.% of n-ZrO2 in the nanocomposite which means the decrease in corrosion rate.

6,Corrosion of indium doped E-AlMgSi aluminum conductor alloy (Aldrey),10.3897/j.moem.7.1.65581,"Ganiev, Izatullo N., Aliev, Firdavs A., Odinazoda, Haydar O., Safarov, Ahror M., Usmonov, Rakhmazhon",2021-03-30,"The effect of impurities on the electrical conductivity of aluminum has been studied in detail. The electrical conductivity of aluminum is 65.45% of that of copper. The tensile strength of aluminum wire is 150–170 MPa which, at equal conductivity, is about 65% of the strength of copper wire. This strength of aluminum wire is sufficient for bearing the wire's own weight but may be too low in case of snow, ice or wind overloads. One way to improve the strength of aluminum wire is to use aluminum alloys having higher strength combined with sufficiently high electrical conductivity, e.g. the E-AlMgSi alloy (Aldrey). The key strengthening agent of the E-AlMgSi alloy (Aldrey) is the Mg2Si phase which imparts high mechanical strength to aluminum. In this work we present experimental data on the kinetics of high-temperature oxidation and electrochemical corrosion of indium doped E-AlMgSi aluminum conductor alloy (Aldrey). Thermal gravimetric study has shown that indium doping and high temperature exposure increase the oxidation rate of E-AlMgSi alloy (Aldrey), with the apparent alloy oxidation activation energy decreasing from 120.5 to 91.8 kJ/mole. Alloy oxidation rate data determined using a potentiostatic technique in NaCl electrolyte media have shown that the corrosion resistance of the indium doped alloy is 20–30% superior to that of the initial alloy. With an increase in NaCl electrolyte concentration the electrochemical potentials of the alloys decrease whereas the corrosion rate increases regardless of alloy composition.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/38516600-2a83-498b-bb84-cae9ff3f3208/MoEM_article_65581.pdf,pdf

A comparative study was conducted regarding the effect of: the type of pretreatment of the Аl substrate; the conversion treatment of the Аl substrate in Се-containing or Р-containing solutions; the consecutive conversion treatment of the Аl substrate in Се-containing and Р-containing solutions. The obtained results indicate that the pre-treatment of the aluminum substrate and the additional phosphate treatment of the Ce-oxide conversion coating deposited on Al 1050 have a strong impact on corrosion-protective effect. We established that the phosphate treatments lead to a transformation of the chemical composition, chemical state of the elements, structure and morphology of the Ce-oxide coatings formed on Al substrates. Oxides and phosphates of Al and Ce are formed, providing an effective barrier to the diffusion of Chloride ions towards the metal surface and increased corrosion resistance (Rp) of Al 1050 to general and pitting corrosion.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques were used to analysis the chemical composition and oxidizing amounts of the outermost machined surface and evaluate if any contamination from foreign particles. The results show that the corrosion of nano aluminum PMEDM on titanium alloy is about 42% reduced as compared to the corrosion of conventional EDM on titanium alloy machined surface. Electric sparks generated during machining decompose the kerosene dielectric fluid into C and H and is resulting in C deposited onto the machined surface.

Fatigue crack growth rate is higher and threshold stress intensities
are lower in aqueous environment compared to the lab air conditions.
It is also observed that the crack growth rate increases at lower
frequencies. The higher stress ratio promotes the crack growth. The
effect of oxidization and corrosion pit formation is very less as the
stress ratio is increased. It is observed that as stress ratios are

21,Corrosion Behaviour of Hypereutectic Al-Si Automotive Alloy in Different pH Environment,10.5281/zenodo.1132623,"M. Al Nur, M. S. Kaiser",2017-09-01,"Corrosion behaviour of hypereutectic Al-19Si automotive alloy in different pH=1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 environments was carried out using conventional gravimetric measurements and was complemented by resistivity, optical micrograph, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray analyzer (EDX) investigations. Gravimetric analysis confirmed that the highest corrosion rate is shown at pH 13 followed by pH 1. Minimum corrosion occurs in the pH range of 3.0 to 11 due to establishment of passive layer on the surface. The highest corrosion rate at pH 13 is due to the presence of sodium hydroxide in the solution which dissolves the surface oxide film at a steady rate. At pH 1, it can be attributed that the presence of aggressive chloride ions serves to pick up the damage of the passive films at localized regions. With varying exposure periods by both, the environment complies with the normal corrosion rate profile that is an initial steep rise followed by a nearly constant value of corrosion rate. Resistivity increases in case of pH 1 solution for the higher pit formation and decreases at pH 13 due to formation of thin film. The SEM image of corroded samples immersed in pH 1 solution clearly shows pores on the surface and in pH 13 solution, and the corrosion layer seems more compact and homogenous and not porous.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/f1bc44bf-ced1-42ea-9d28-9cd0296af2c8/10008132.pdf,pdf

23,The assessment of reflector material durability for concentrated solar power based on environment exposure and accelerated aging test,10.15587/1729-4061.2022.265678,"Budhi Muliawan Suyitno, Reza Abdu Rahman, Hendri Sukma, Dwi Rahmalin",2022-12-30,"The reflector durability is essential to maintain suitable photo-to-thermal conversion in concentrated solar power plants. The present study evaluates the impact of environmental exposure and accelerated aging of the reflector material. The study is conducted to assess the reflector material's durability to withstand environmental exposure and accelerated aging test. The evaluation is conducted using four different reflector materials commonly used in concentrated solar power: stainless steel and silvered-glass mirror (solid-state reflector), aluminum and silvered-polymer film (sheet-based reflector). The environmental exposure and accelerated aging test are conducted for 1,080 hours according to the standard reference of ISO 8565:2011 and ASTM B117–11. The mass loss after exposure is used as a reference to determine the corrosion rate for each reflector. Further observation is conducted by using microscope light to observe the effect of exposure on the surface of the reflector. Each reflector indicates a different corrosion rate which implies different weather resistance for each reflector type. The highest corrosion rate is found on aluminum film, with a value of 295.8 g/m2.year. The accelerated aging test through neutral salt spray demonstrates that a metallic reflector has a higher corrosion rate compared to a silvered-glass mirror which uses silicon dioxide as the top coating. Microscope observation demonstrates that suitable protection from soiling elements for the silvered-glass mirror is mainly caused by the presence of silicon dioxide on the top surface of this reflector. The assessment suggests that a suitable coating can be developed to be used for reflector protection. Furthermore, the corrosion mechanism is observed clearly, which can be referred to the synthesis of new reflective material that withstands environment and salt exposure.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/4373d097-b2ef-4e5c-a988-cd0a9307e852/The%20assessment%20of%20reflector%20material%20durability%20for%20concentrated%20solar%20power%20based%20on%20environment%20exposure%20and%20accelerated%20aging%20test.pdf,pdf

Topuz",2016-04-01,"The corrosion behaviour of 316L stainless steel coatings obtained by cold spray method was investigated in this study. 316L powders were deposited onto Al5052 aluminum substrates. The coatings were produced using nitrogen (N2) process gas. In order to further improve the corrosion and mechanical properties of the coatings, heat treatment was applied at 250 and 750 °C. The corrosion performances of the coatings were compared using the potentiodynamic scanning (PDS) technique under in-vitro conditions (in Ringer’s solution at 37 °C). In addition, the hardness and porosity tests were carried out on the coatings. Microstructural characterization of the coatings was carried out by using scanning electron microscopy attached with energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. It was found that clean surfaces and a good adhesion were achieved for particle/substrate bonding. The heat treatment process provided both elimination of the anisotropy in the coating and resulting in healing-up of the incomplete interfaces between the deposited particles. It was found that the corrosion potential of the annealed coatings at 750 °C was higher than that of commercially 316 L stainless steel. Moreover, the microstructural investigations after the corrosion tests revealed that corrosion preferentially starts at inter-splat boundaries.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/fabe4f92-26bd-4329-aead-16eb58761092/10004443.pdf,pdf

Aluminum is ideally suited to anodizing, although other nonferrous metals, such as magnesium and titanium, also can be anodized. The anodic oxide structure originates from the aluminum substrate and is composed entirely of aluminum oxide. This aluminum oxide is not applied to the surface like paint or plating, but is fully integrated with the underlying aluminum substrate, so cannot chip or peel. It has a highly ordered, porous structure that allows for secondary processes such as coloring and sealing. In this experimental paper, we focus on a reliable method for fabricating nanoporous alumina with high regularity. Starting from study of nanostructure materials synthesize methods. After that, porous alumina fabricate in the laboratory by anodization of aluminum oxide. Hard anodization processes are employed to fabricate the nanoporous alumina using 0.3M oxalic acid and 90, 120 and 140 anodized voltages. The nanoporous templates were characterized by SEM and FFT. The nanoporous templates using 140 voltages have high ordered. The pore formation, influence of the experimental conditions on the pore formation, the structural characteristics of the pore and the oxide chemical reactions involved in the pore growth are discuss.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/359f102d-a9d0-41b2-83ff-b8ee09be4855/11121.pdf,pdf

Currently aluminum and its alloys successfully replace conventional metals and alloys in a number of application fields. The wide use of aluminum and its alloys is primarily stipulated by its advantageous properties e.g. low density, high corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity as well as the possibility of applying protective and decorative coatings. In combination with great abundance and relatively low cost which has been almost constant in recent years, this permanently broadens the application range of aluminum. The electrochemical industry is one of the promising application fields of aluminum. The E-AlMgSi type (Aldrey) conductor aluminum alloy has high strength and ductility. This alloy acquires high electrical conductivity upon appropriate heat treatment. Products made from it are used almost exclusively for overhead power lines. This work presents data on the temperature dependence of heat capacity, heat conductivity and thermodynamic functions of the E-AlMgSi (Aldrey) aluminum alloy doped with gallium. The studies have been carried out in ""cooling"" mode. It has been shown that with an increase in temperature the heat capacity and thermodynamic functions of E-AlMgSi (Aldrey) alloy doped with gallium increase while the Gibbs energy decreases. Gallium doping to 1 wt.% reduces the heat capacity, enthalpy and entropy of the initial alloy and increases the Gibbs energy.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/69b32323-e980-45cb-a496-b7d7641e2cca/MoEM_article_55277.pdf,pdf

[1-3].Electro-less or autocatalytic plating involves the chemical reducing agent to convert metallic ions into metallic state in the solution. In electro-less plating, substrate acts as cathode andthe salt is used as anode. Electric current is passed through salt instead of electrodes and reducing agent provides electrons. Surface cleaning and activation is necessary for deposition and different metals have different methods of cleaning and activation[4].Electro-less nickel-phosphorus alloy coatings are of great interest now a day due to their successful properties such as high hardness, good corrosion resistance, uniform thickness and good magnetic response. These coatings are considered as functional coatings due to their applications in different industries such automotive, aerospace, chemical, oil and gas[5].

Electro-less Ni-W-P coating on aluminum substrate is useful coating to avoid pitting corrosion and to increase hardness. It has many applications in different industries such as different types of control valves, engine valves, aluminum blow molds, aluminum pelletizers, bearings, rollers, gears, hydraulics, aluminum fuel filters, components in contact with alcohol, aluminum connecters, spacers and assemblies etc. In electro-less Ni-W-P coating, sodium hypophosphite is used as reducing agent to reduce nickel metal ions. Chemical reduction takes place in this method[6].Aluminum substrates make a strong oxide layer on its surface which is destroyed in corrosive environment so electro-less Ni-W-P coating is applied to protect aluminum from pitting corrosion. Due to oxide layer, there is poor adhesion between substrate and the required coating. Zincacting is the process which enhances the adhesion. In this process thin layer of zinc is applied after activation of the substrate. Thin layer of copper plating may also be done for reinforcement of the coating. In electro-less plating, firstly nucleation sites (activation sites) are formed which are main center to start and to continue the coating. When work piece is immersed into the solution, islands start to form around the nucleation sites and then these sites increases in size and merge in each other with passage of time. Thus, a dense and uniform coating is formed and this phenomenon is time dependent. Nucleation sites also changes the direction of the crystals deposited on the substrate with the help of ions supplied from the solution.

The purpose of the present study is to obtain an effective coating with increased corrosion resistance in corrosive environment. Electro-less Ni-W-P coating is directly carried out on pure aluminum and effect of bath temperature on crystal structure, deposition rate; surface morphology, chemical composition and corrosion resistance of Ni-W-P plated aluminum are observed.
Aluminum (Al) substrates of 99.5% purity, 1×2cm2, were cut in form of strips. Ni-W-P deposit was obtained from different chemicals such as sodium tungstate, sodium hypophosphite, and nickel sulfate are the materials used for experimental work.
Pickling and degreasing is followed in this work because it is effective for the adhesion of coatings.Oxide layer was removed from the sample by washing with detergent followed by pickled in a solution of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid (HNO3+HF, 3:1) for 2min. The washed and surface clean samples was then used for coating.To remove oxide layer, firstly zinc coating was done on aluminum substrate for 10sec at 30˚C. For reinforcement of Ni-W-P coating, copper electroplating was through above zinc coating at 4.5A of current upon 60˚C. The change in the physiochemical properties of aluminum, Ni-W-P alloy coating is then employed above copper electroplating. Chemical composition of Ni-W-P coating is given below in table 1.

The hardness of as received and coated samples were determined by Micro-Vickers hardness machine having 490.3mN load. Potentiostat was used for corrosion test and cyclic polarization test was performed to analyze pitting corrosion as aluminum suffers from pitting corrosion. For that analysis, electrolyte was made in 1000ml distilled water containing 0.9% NaCl with HCl giving 4-5 PH. Electrolyte in another beaker was made with graphite electrode and standard electrode. Then samples were tested to get corrosion curves. The micrographs of coated specimens were carried out on scanning electron microscope (SEM) (S-3000N) at different magnifications such as 250X, 370X, 500X, 1000X, 3000X, 7000X and 10000X to identified different modes of surfaces.
The SEM results of electro-less nickel alloy coating with secondary zinc and copper treatment shows that the surface topography of the deposit contains spherical nodular structure with very fine and compact grains. The surface morphology of the coating is shown in figure 1. These results clearly indicates that nodular size decreases with increase in tungsten content which indicates that deposit is adherent. Electro-less Ni-P-W deposition is a time dependent nucleation and growth phenomena for an adherent coating. Firstly, after nucleation, the Ni-P alloy grains grow into spherical nodules. Secondly, the number of nucleating sites increases with time, creating more nodules. With increase in plating time, deposition on surface occurs and then these new deposited Ni-P alloy particles become new nucleation center to deposit further particles. So, deposition rate of phosphorus and tungsten particles increases until surface is completely covered with coating. The as-formed coating has the catalytic activity required for the autocatalytic reaction, and this promoted the nucleation and growth of the coating in the transverse direction. Fig.1shows micrographs of Ni-W-P coating with 7, 9 and 11g/l Na2WO4 compositions at magnification of 7000X.

Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) was done to detect energy spectrum as shown in figure 2. It is investigated that the surface of the sample contains elements of Ni, W, P, Cu and Zn because the sample is subjected to zinc and copper treatment before electro-less Ni-W-P plating.  The contents of the coating increase with increase in time but content of zinc and copper disappear gradually after some time because nickel, tungsten, phosphorus particles are mainly deposited on zinc and copper coating. Figure 2illustrate the composition spectrums of different concentrations of Na2WO4 such as 7, 9 and 11%.

The cyclic polarization curve of bare aluminum and coated samples with different concentration of tungsten was observed as shown in Figure 3. Cyclic Polarization test tells about probability of pitting corrosion, breakdown potential (Pitting Potential) and protection potential. According to the graph given below, in pure aluminum no loop is made which means that there is severe pitting corrosion. As tungsten content is increased, a hysteresis loop is made but loop is not closed which means that there is some pitting corrosion. The area of loop tells about the probability of pitting corrosion. As further tungsten content is increased, revers scan becomes close to forward scan showing less pitting corrosion and when more tungsten content is increased then loop becomes close which indicate protection potential which means that coating is protected.
In curves in figure 3 suggests that samples are firstly catholically polarized where hydrogen evolution occurs and then anodically polarized where metal dissolution occurs. This scan is called forward scan. After that a potential is given to take metal ions from solution which is called reverse scan. When forward scan cut the revers scan then protection potential is reported. After 60 minutes, coating becomes saturated with improved coverage and thickness.

Corrosion potential and corrosion current shows in increasing trend by adding intermediate copper and zinc layers corrosion potential is increased which indicates better adherence between coating and substrate. Copper layer is introduced because it has lower difference of coefficient of thermal expansion with Ni-W-P coating and it also makes good adhesion with zinc. Hence, corrosion resistance is increased by introducing copper layer.
The hardness of Ni-W-P coating increases with increase in concentration of tungsten content and time as shown in Figure.4given below. Due to increase in the concentration of tungsten the spherical size decrease and particle become smaller due to which hardness increases.

4.Conclusions
After the electro less plating for a fix time, the Ni-W-P particles deposited on the surface of the sample were seen to increase with the plating time.  The particles begin to accumulate, grow, fuse, and have a nodular structure on the surface. During the initial stage of electro-less nickel plating, nickel-phosphorus particles were deposited near the Cu particles and between the Cu particles. Zincating process was used for activation of surface and to get fine nodules of the coating. Zinc and copper layers were plated before Ni-W-P coating for better adhesion.
Hardness was increased with the increase in tungsten content and plating time which can be used to replace some metals and save resources. With increase in plating time, thickness of the coating was increased and porosity was decreased. Atomic binding force against plastic deformation was increased by co-deposition of tungsten so that the hardness of the deposits of Ni–W–P was higher than the Ni–P deposits and substrate. Thus, the properties of electro-less Ni–P coatings were enhanced by co-deposition with tungsten. Electro-less Ni–P–W plating exhibited a nodular surface profile. Corrosion studies indicated that as composition of sodium tungstate increases, coating becomes nobler. As a result, the bonding of Ni–W–P deposit and aluminium substrate is in good condition.

The effect of using light-alloy drill pipes (LADP) depends directly on the properties of the aluminum alloys from which such pipes are made. As the wells become deeper and horizontal wellbores get longer, use of LADPs becomes more relevant. Since light-alloy pipes are 2.8 times softer than steel pipes, LADPs offer the same performance as steel drill pipes of the lowest strength grade even in the case of rotary drilling. The materials from which such pipes are made have a number of unique advantages: extra light weight in the drill mud, allowing the coefficient of sliding friction between the pipe surface and the borehole wall to be reduced; high corrosion resistance in aggressive media with A high concentration of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide; and high magnetic inductive capacity that allows LADPs to be used as a housing for MWD (measurement while drilling) and LWD (logging while drilling) telemetry systems during well-drilling operations. This study suggests methods for industrial production of submicrocrystalline (SMC) structure in aluminum alloys with the help of severe plastic deformation. Through the example of model aluminum-lithium alloys 1420 (Al-Mg-Li-Zr) and 1460 (Al-Сu-Li-Zr), the researchers demonstrate that SMC structure helps significantly increase resistance to wear and reduce the rate of corrosion depending on the pH value. The research team also states that severe plastic deformation methods may be used to develop highly promising technologies for manufacture of high-strength LADPs with advanced strain-stress properties for use during operations in the Arctic.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/6a803a88-f8a3-4e7f-a18d-fc5943264893/AER_article_26035.pdf,pdf

The corrosion of aluminum in trichloroacetic acid (TCA) containing methylthymolblue complexon has been studied. In plain trichloroacetic acid, the corrosion rate increases with the acid concentration. At constant acid concentration, the inhibition efficiency (IE) of methylthymolblue complexon increases with the inhibitor concentration. At constant inhibitor concentration, the IE decreases with the increase of acid concentration. As temperature increases, percentage of inhibition decreases. Plot of log (θ/1 - θ) versus log C results in a straight line, suggesting that the inhibitors cover both the anodic and cathodic regions through general adsorption following Langmuir isotherm. The curves show very little anodic but significant cathodic polarization.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/610eaf7d-b24b-4ffd-a5d7-014af737d288/92-96.pdf,pdf

Al-Qawabeha, Taha A. Tabaza, Safwan Moh`d Al-Qawabah, Valentin Shnayder",2020-06-30,"The influence of electrolysis conditions at different electrolyte compositions on the phase formation and properties of coatings obtained by microarc oxidation (MAO) on an aluminum alloy AMg6 was studied. For electrolysis, three types of electrolytes were used: alkaline electrolyte ((KOH) solution in distilled water), silicate electrolyte (with different percentages of Na2SiO3 component) and complex alkaline silicate electrolyte with liquid glass (1÷12 g/l Na2SiO3) and potassium hydroxide (1÷6 g/l KOH). An analysis of the results showed that the choice of electrolyte type and conditions of the microarc oxidation process allows a wide variation in the phase-structural state, thickness and properties of the AMg6 aluminum alloy. The criterion for the expected phase-structural state of the coatings as a result of microarc oxidation is the completeness of the γ–Al2O3→α–Al2O3 transformation process during coating formation. The use of an alkaline electrolyte does not allow achieving a high hardness of the coating due to the formation of the γ-Al2O3 phase and the absence of thermodynamic conditions for the γ–Al2O3→α–Al2O3 transition. When using a silicate electrolyte, it is possible to significantly increase the growth rate of the coating, but at the same time, the presence of a large specific Si concentration stimulates the formation of mullite and an amorphous-like phase. The use of a combined alkaline silicate electrolyte (with different percentages of KOH+Na2SiO3) with a low content (6 g/l) of Na2SiO3 in solution stimulates the formation of mullite. This is manifested to the greatest extent with the lowest content (1 g/l) of the KOH component. At a higher content (2 g/l) of the KOH component, the processes characteristic of an alkaline electrolyte become dominant. This leads to an incomplete transformation reaction and the formation of only the γ-Al2O3 phase. The achievement of the thermodynamic conditions of the γ–Al2O3→α–Al2O3 conversion became possible with an increase in the specific Na2SiO3 content in the electrolyte solution to 12 g/l. In this case, MAO coatings were formed on the AMg6 alloy with the highest hardness of 1500 kg/mm2 and high electric strength of 12 V/μm",https://zenodo.org/api/files/34e14d13-5bfe-4d2a-aa97-235c5027b3d3/A%20study%20of%20the%20electrolyte%20composition%20influence%20on%20the%20structure%20and%20properties%20of%20MAO%20coatings%20formed%20on%20AMg6%20alloy.pdf,pdf

The present work proposes to characterize the microstructure of the aluminum alloy 5052, which is an aluminum and magnesium alloy that was subjected to different heat treatments. The proposal to study the league is justified by the use of it in sectors such as the naval and with that the analysis of its characteristics can bring possibilities of improvements to its properties, revealing positive and negative points, and improve the performance of the alloy during its applications. As a methodology to achieve the objective, four samples of 5052 aluminum were used, one was subjected to annealing, one to normalization, and two to solubilization (one cooled in water while the other in oil). Afterwards, the samples were embedded, sanded, polished and attacked with hydrochloric acid to visualize its microstructure in an optical microscope. As a result, four samples were obtained with different microstructures, the annealed sample showed a greater amount of α phase (rich in aluminum) and precipitated magnesium in the form of dark spots, the normalized sample presented the α phase and the β phase (in vermicular form), the solubilized samples showed a saturated magnesium microstructure (martensitic microstructure). In this way, it can be concluded that, just as in ferrous alloys, non-ferrous alloys can go under heat treatments and have changes in their microstructural characteristics. The application of heat treatments to the aluminum alloy 5052 caused considerable changes in the microstructure of the alloy and even the type of cooling used during the procedure influenced these changes.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/de5b9c33-6223-4720-93fb-ce0e16fc8d39/EAR%204325.pdf,pdf

The inhibition properties of the novel cumini extract were thoroughly characterized using potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and atomic force microscope (AFM). The results show that the cumini inhibitor has excellent corrosion inhibition with 93 % inhibition efficiency. The adsorption behavior of the inhibitor follows the Langmuir Adsorption Isotherm due to the nearness of R2 to unity. The potentiodynamic and electrochemical measurements demonstrate the mixed type of corrosion inhibitor.

Some reinforcement is added in the surface of metal to enhance its properties. The process known as Friction Stir Processing produces surface composite by refining the grain size and total rearrangement of surface particles. Friction Stir Processing is a promising method which is more beneficial than all other recent methods. It is based on the principle of Friction Stir Welding. Large amount of progress has seen in this process after its development. Metals like aluminum and magnesium are mostly processed by this process as it is easier to process them. But now with the evolution of the process metals like tungsten and nickel which are very hard having high density has also been processed by this technique. Aluminum alloys can be easily processed by Friction Stir Processing when compared to other metals. In this study friction stir processing of aluminium alloys is observed. Aluminium alloys forms metal matrix composites when reinforcements are added on the metal surface either by drilling holes or by cutting a groove. Friction Stir Processing has great impact on the surface microstructure and on the mechanical properties of these aluminium metals composite. Reinforcements can be added as hybrid which is mixing of two materials and a hybrid surface composite is produced. Micro-hardness test, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy is to be conducted to inspect the surface hardness and microstructure refinement of composite. Effects of rotational speed, translation speed and number of passes are to be observed. The results obtained are then compared with the processed material without reinforcement and with the combination of reinforcement added surface composite.",Inconnu,Inconnu

To stop corrosion, corrosion inhibitors are used that must be constantly improved and whose composition must be properly adjusted. The main drawback of the highly effective inhibitors based on alkyl imidazolines, a mixture of alkyl imidazolines with alkyl pyridinium and/or quaternary ammonium compounds soluble in a methanol medium, is their high prices at relatively significant consumption in the corrosive environment. This paper reports the synthesis of steel corrosion inhibitors in oil-containing aqueous environments that meet the stricter ecological and economic requirements. It has been shown that increasing the level of water mineralization improves the corrosive activity of aqueous environments relative to unalloyed steels. The presence of carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, or carboxylic acids leads to the oxidation of water-oil mixtures resulting in the increased rate of steel corrosion. We have studied the effectiveness of the synthesized inhibitors based on oil and polyethylene polyamines containing imidazolines. At a temperature of 80 °C, the mixture that contained 200 cm3of a 3 % sodium chloride solution, 800 cm3of oil, and at the concentration of acetic acid of 0.5 and 3.0 g/dm3 at the inhibitor dose of 50 mg/dm3, has reached the degree of protection of steel against corrosion at the level of 90–92 %. Based on a full factorial experiment, the regression equation has been derived that makes it possible to easily enough calculate an optimal dose of the steel corrosion inhibitor in water-oil mixtures. It has been shown that the synthesized inhibitor shows prospects for protecting metals against corrosion both in the mineralized waters containing oil and in the presence of petroleum products containing water",https://zenodo.org/api/files/030592a9-5271-49bf-a92d-4fc640d5c344/Synthesis%20of%20high-effective%20steel%20corrosion%20inhibitors%20in%20water-oil%20mixtures.pdf,pdf

Prabhu",2013-11-03,"Metal matrix composites consists of a metallic matrix combined with dispersed particulate phase as reinforcement. Aluminum alloys have been the primary material of choice for structural components of aircraft since about 1930. Well known performance characteristics, known fabrication costs, design experience, and established manufacturing methods and facilities, are just a few of the reasons for the continued confidence in 7XXX Al alloys that will ensure their use in significant quantities for the time to come. Particulate MMCs are of special interest owing to the low cost of their raw materials (primarily natural river sand here) and their ease of fabrication, making them suitable for applications requiring relatively high volume production. 7XXX Al alloys are precipitation hardenable and therefore amenable for thermomechanical treatment. Al–Zn alloys reinforced with particulate materials are used in aerospace industries in spite of the drawbacks of susceptibility to stress corrosion, poor wettability, poor weldability and poor fatigue resistance. The resistance offered by these particulates for the moving dislocations impart secondary hardening in turn contributes strain hardening. Cold deformation increases lattice defects, which in turn improves the properties of solution treated alloy. In view of this, six different Al–Zn–Mg alloy composites reinforced with silica (3 wt. % and 5 wt. %) are prepared by conventional semisolid synthesizing process. The cast alloys are solution treated and aged. The solution treated alloys are further severely cold rolled to enhance the properties. The hardness and strength values are analyzed and compared with silica free Al – Zn-Mg alloys. Precipitation hardening phenomena is accelerated due to the increased number of potential sites for precipitation. Higher peak hardness and lesser aging time are the characteristics of thermo mechanically treated samples. For obtaining maximum hardness, optimum number and volume of precipitate particles are required. The Al-5Zn-1Mg with 5% SiO2 alloy composite shows better result.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/b5111377-3de1-4c66-95b0-4a6429af3b13/9996749.pdf,pdf

As corrosion is characterized by the destruction of a material as a result of interaction with the environment, one of the expedient methods for its minimization is the use of inhibitors. Therefore, it is a relevant task for environmental protection and economic development of the country to devise effective means to protect metals against corrosion. The reported inhibitor AC-2 (the solution of a mixture of 2-alkylimidazolines in methanol) rather effectively protects steel against corrosion in water-oil mixtures at the high concentrations of mineral salts in water. The efficacy of the inhibitor is almost unaffected by the ratio of the volumes of oil and concentrated aqueous solutions of sodium chloride. When using the inhibitor at a concentration of 50 mg/dm3, the degree of protection of steel against corrosion exceeded 90 %. This is due to the fact that the protection of steel against corrosion occurs through the adsorption of the imidazoline components at the metal surface and the adsorption of organic oil components on the hydrophobic alkyl groups of 2-alkylimidazolines. In this case, the hydrophobization of the metal surface proceeds in the presence of minor quantities of oil. It has been shown that in the mixture that contained 200 cm3 of a 3 % sodium chloride solution and 800 cm3 of oil at the concentration of acetic acid, respectively, 0.5 and 3.0 g/dm3 at a temperature of 80 °C at a dose of the inhibitor of 15‒50 mg/dm3 the efficiency reached 72−92 %.

particulates (Al2O3), graphite added with 0, 2, 3, 4 and 5 wt% fly ash
were utilized to prepare 10wt% reinforcing phase with Zn-27Al alloy
as matrix using two-step stir casting method. Density measurement,
estimated percentage porosity, tensile testing, micro hardness
measurement and optical microscopy were used to assess the
performance of the composites produced. The results show that the
hardness, ultimate tensile strength, and percent elongation of the
hybrid composites decrease with increase in fly ash content. The
maximum decrease in hardness and ultimate tensile strength of
13.72% and 15.25% respectively were observed for composite grade
containing 5wt% fly ash. The percentage elongation of composite
sample without fly ash is 8.9% which is comparable with that of the
sample containing 2wt% fly ash with percentage elongation of 8.8%.
The fracture toughness of the fly ash containing composites was
however superior to those of composites without fly ash with 5wt%

76,Microstructure and Corrosion Behavior of Laser Welded Magnesium Alloys with Silver Nanoparticles,10.5281/zenodo.1331663,"M. Ishak, K. Yamasaki, K. Maekawa",2010-09-29,"Magnesium alloys have gained increased attention in recent years in automotive, electronics, and medical industry. This because of magnesium alloys have better properties than aluminum alloys and steels in respects of their low density and high strength to weight ratio. However, the main problems of magnesium alloy welding are the crack formation and the appearance of porosity during the solidification. This paper proposes a unique technique to weld two thin sheets of AZ31B magnesium alloy using a paste containing Ag nanoparticles. The paste containing Ag nanoparticles of 5 nm in average diameter and an organic solvent was used to coat the surface of AZ31B thin sheet. The coated sheet was heated at 100 °C for 60 s to evaporate the solvent. The dried sheet was set as a lower AZ31B sheet on the jig, and then lap fillet welding was carried out by using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser in a closed box filled with argon gas. The characteristics of the microstructure and the corrosion behavior of the joints were analyzed by opticalmicroscopy (OM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and immersion corrosion test. The experimental results show that the wrought AZ31B magnesium alloy can be joined successfully using Ag nanoparticles.

Corrosion rate of welded AZ31B with Ag nanoparticles reduced up to 44 % compared to base metal. The improvement of corrosion resistance of welded AZ31B with Ag nanoparticles due to finer grains and large grain boundaries area which consist of high Al content. β-phase Mg17Al12 could serve as effective barrier and suppressed further propagation of corrosion.

The ICCP system is suitable for coastal applications such as piping systems and offshore structures. In this application, metal surfaces tend to be exposed to seawater. Specific concentrations of seawater can accelerate the occurrence of corrosion of metals, even though they are stainless steel types. This study applied the automatic ICCP system to stainless steel 303. Stainless steel 303 will be immersed in simulated seawater at several concentrations of NaCl (27 ppt, 31 ppt, and 35 ppt). The specimens were immersed in NaCl solution for three weeks or about 504 hours at a constant temperature of 38 °C. After the sample has been soaked, quantitative and qualitative measurements were carried out. Quantitative measures include average weight loss, corrosion rate, and potential value. At the same time, the qualitative measurements include macroscopic, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS). Based on quantitative measures, it was found that the difference in average weight loss and corrosion rate for each NaCl concentration was not very significant. The difference of each parameter is less than 0.1 % and 0.22 %, respectively. The potential value quickly reaches a steady state at NaCl concentrations of 27 ppt and 31 ppt in less than 10 seconds. The results of the SEM test showed a change in the metal structure. The oxygen (O) content in the metal after the EDS test showed a decrease in this element up to 35 % at a NaCl concentration of 35 ppt. The decrease in oxygen (O) can slow down the corrosion rate in metals when exposed to seawater.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/376e9d24-4deb-424d-8464-6f6b93a5e612/Suppression%20of%20corrosion%20on%20stainless%20steel%20303%20with%20automatic%20impressed%20current%20cathodic%20protection%20%28a-ICCP%29%20method%20in%20simulated%20seawater.pdf,pdf

The results of studying the surface morphology, phase composition, and hardness of MAO coatings are presented. The change parameters were the electrolyte composition and the concentration of alloying (Cu and Zn) elements. This study was carried out because the currently available data are not enough to understand the nature of the influence of the chemical composition of the aluminum alloy and electrolysis conditions (in particular, electrolyte composition) on the mechanism and kinetics of γ→α transformation. Without understanding this, a directed change in the structural state and properties of MAO coatings becomes impossible. As a result of the studies, it was found that during microarc oxidation of aluminum alloys in an alkaline electrolyte with the addition of liquid glass (Na2SiO3) of various concentrations, the strengthened layer consists of oxides α-A12O3, γ-A12O3 and mullite 3Al2O3·2SiO2. The data of x-ray diffraction analysis of the coatings indicate the crystal structure of the coatings. It was established that aluminum alloying with copper and zinc significantly affects the phase composition of the coating, changing the quantitative ratio of the phases in a nonlinear manner. The highest content of the α-A12O3 phase (up to 60 vol. %) is achieved by Cu doping. The highest hardness of MAO coatings is achieved using an electrolyte with a composition of 1 g/l KOH and 6 g/l Na2SiO3 in aluminum alloys with a copper content of more than 3 %, and zinc – 2–3 %. It is established that the mechanism of formation of the phase composition should be associated with stabilization and destabilization of the γ-A12O3 phase. Therefore, to achieve high hardness, it is necessary to choose those alloying elements that affect the destabilization of γ-A12O3, which ensures the formation of the α-A12O3 phase (corundum).

Nickel-base superalloys are popular as base materials for hot components in industrial gas turbines such as blades due to their superior mechanical performance and high-temperature oxidation resistance, but the combustion gases' existence generates hot oxidation at high temperatures for long durations of time, resulting in corrosion of turbine blades which lead to massive economic losses. Turbine blades used in Iraqi electrical gas power stations require costly maintenance using traditional processes regularly. These blades are made of nickel superalloys such as IN 738 LC(Inconel 738). Few scientists investigated the impact of Al2O3 or Al additions to Nickel-base superalloys as coating layer by using the slurry coating method on oxidation resistance to enhance the Nickel-base superalloy's oxidation resistance.

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) were performed on all samples before and after oxidation. According to the results, SEM images of the surface revealed that the layer of the surface has a relatively moderated porosity value and that some of the coating layers contain micro-cracks. The best surface roughness of specimens coated with 60 % alumina+40 % aluminum was 5.752 nm.

Moreover,the NiCrAl2O3 thermal coating has good oxidation resistance and the effective temperature of anti-oxidation is raised to 1100 °C in turn reducing the maintenance period of turbine blades",https://zenodo.org/api/files/71f1a9ce-3f54-498d-be5c-1a488526d943/Investigation%20of%20evaluated%20temperature%20oxidation%20for%20IN-738%20LC%20superalloy%20turbine%20blade%20thermally%20coated%20by%20AL2O3%20using%20slurry%20coating%20process.pdf,pdf
96,Drafting the Design and Development of Micro- Controller Based Portable Soil Moisture Sensor for Advancement in Agro Engineering,10.5281/zenodo.1058417,"Guneet Mander, Gurinder Pal Singh",2013-06-27,"Moisture is an important consideration in many
aspects ranging from irrigation, soil chemistry, golf course, corrosion
and erosion, road conditions, weather predictions, livestock feed
moisture levels, water seepage etc. Vegetation and crops always
depend more on the moisture available at the root level than on
precipitation occurrence. In this paper, design of an instrument is
discussed which tells about the variation in the moisture contents of
soil. This is done by measuring the amount of water content in soil by
finding the variation in capacitance of soil with the help of a
capacitive sensor. The greatest advantage of soil moisture sensor is
reduced water consumption. The sensor is also be used to set lower
and upper threshold to maintain optimum soil moisture saturation and
minimize water wilting, contributes to deeper plant root growth
,reduced soil run off /leaching and less favorable condition for insects
and fungal diseases. Capacitance method is preferred because, it
provides absolute amount of water content and also measures water
content at any depth.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/a9da406e-3e95-4011-971d-4ee51545b518/3062.pdf,pdf
97,A Systematic Approach for Identifying Turning Center Capabilities with Vertical Machining Center in Milling Operation,10.5281/zenodo.2659040,"Joseph Chen, N. Hundal",2014-05-22,"Conventional machining is a form of subtractive manufacturing, in which a collection of material-working processes utilizing power-driven machine tools are used to remove undesired material to achieve a desired geometry. This paper presents an approach for comparison between turning center and vertical machining center by optimization of cutting parameters at cylindrical workpieces leading to minimum surface roughness by using taguchi methodology. Aluminum alloy was taken to conduct experiments due to its unique high strength-weight ratio that is maintained at elevated temperatures and their exceptional corrosion resistance. During testing, the effects of the cutting parameters on the surface roughness were investigated. Additionally, by using taguchi methodology for each of the cutting parameters (spindle speed, depth of cut, insert diameter, and feed rate) minimum surface roughness for the process of turn-milling was determined according to the cutting parameters. A confirmation experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of taguchi method.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/5b499557-d5ae-478d-949f-e3304860531a/5128.pdf,pdf
99,Characterization Study of Aluminium 6061 Hybrid Composite,10.5281/zenodo.1107183,"U. Achutha Kini, S. S. Sharma, K. Jagannath, P. R. Prabhu, Gowri Shankar M. C.",2015-06-02,"Aluminium matrix composites with alumina
reinforcements give superior mechanical & physical properties. Their
applications in several fields like automobile, aerospace, defense,
sports, electronics, bio-medical and other industrial purposes are
becoming essential for the last several decades. In the present work,
fabrication of hybrid composite was done by Stir casting technique
using Al 6061 as a matrix with alumina and silicon carbide (SiC) as
reinforcement materials. The weight percentage of alumina is varied
from 2 to 4% and the silicon carbide weight percentage is maintained
constant at 2%. Hardness and wear tests are performed in the as cast
and heat treated conditions. Age hardening treatment was performed
on the specimen with solutionizing at 550°C, aging at two
temperatures (150 and 200°C) for different time durations. Hardness
distribution curves are drawn and peak hardness values are recorded.
Hardness increase was very sensitive with respect to the decrease in
aging temperature. There was an improvement in wear resistance of
the peak aged material when aged at lower temperature. Also
increase in weight percent of alumina, increases wear resistance at
lower temperature but opposite behavior was seen when aged at
higher temperature.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/d4eac8ce-10d0-43c9-9787-5e31729aac90/10001700.pdf,pdf
