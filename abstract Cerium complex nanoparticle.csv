Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the progressive neurological diseases that are associated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta of brain. Administration of drugs such as levodopa or dopamine agonists helps to increase dopamine concentration but is impeded by the endothelial layer of blood-brain barrier resulting ineffective treatment. Nanotechnology approaches have created new vistas in order to solve this burning issue. 85 nm PEGylated immunoliposome encapsulated tyrosine hydroxylase expression plasmid effectively crosses blood brain barrier and restores motor behaviour in rat model. Non-viral gene therapy comprising of Lactoferrin modified nanoparticle vectors of size 196±10 nm have gener­ated neuro protective effects. Additionally another agent known as poly-hydroxylated fullerene derivative C60(OH)24 induces positive effect in MPP+ induced PD model with its free radical scavenging activity and antioxidant potential. Equally reveal­ing is the information about smart material namely cerium oxide nanoparticle or nanoceria as a ROS scavenger to decrease oxidative stress. In this review, attempt has been made to evaluate the role of nanotechnology for the remediation of PD.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/b4798f78-8929-4e94-ae05-9a03c5211bd2/August-13.pdf,pdf

The reaction shows first order kinetics in [CeIV] and an apparent less than unit order dependence each in [DL-methionine] and [acid]. The data suggest that the oxidation proceeds via the formation of a complex between methionine and cerium(IV) which decomposes in a slow step to give a free radical which on reacting with one more molecule of cerium(IV) in a fast step gives the products.

Cerium(m) ion-catalysed bromate oxidation of citric acid in aqueous acetic acid media containing HCIO4
and mercury(II), a bromo-complex-forming metal ion, exhibits first-order in [bromate] and less than unit order in [citric acid] and [cerium(lll)]. Reaction rate increases linearly with an increase in [HCIO4]. However, an opposite effect is observed with[H2SO4] and [NaHSO4]. D2O and Hg(OAc)2 have insignificant effect on the rate of reaction. The catalytic effect of Ceiii ion is displayed by its complex forming ability and in the proposed mechanism it is assumed that acid bromate reacts with the CeIII-citric acid binary complex, whose formation (Kc) is precedent to the bromate-cerium(III) reaction, and results a ternary complex (Kr), which subsequently decomposes (kd) into products with the regeneration of CeIII • The effects of ionic strength and dielectric constant of the media are also in accordance with the proposed mechanism.

The products are identified as cerium(III)-EDTA complex, n-methylphthalimide and formaldehyde. The order with respect to oxidant concentration is unity, whereas the order with respect to both substrate and catalyst concentration is less than unity. Increase in sulphuric acid concentration increases the rate of reaction. The order with respect to H+ ion concentration is less than unity.

Oxidation of 2-phenyl ethanol and 2-methyl cyclohexanol by cerium(IV) sulphate in aqueous sulphuric acid medium is greatly enhanced by iridium(III) chloride. Catalyst combines with the complex formed between cerium(Iv) and organic substrate and ultimately gives rise to corresponding aromatic dicarboxylic acids as the product of oxidation. Reactions follows direct proportionality with respect to catalyst concentrations while the first order kinetics shown by the oxidant and organic substrate at their low concentrations become zero order at higher concentrations of both oxidant and organic substrate. Rate decreased with increasing concentrations of H+ ions. Externally added CeIII and Cl- ions have negative effects on the reaction rate. Stoichiometry of the reaction was determined and the final oxidation products were identified to be 2-phenyl ethanoic acid and 2-methyl hexane-1,6-dioic acid respectively for 2-phenyl ethanol and 2- methyl cyclohexanol.

is a result of two types of interactions : the material specific affinity and the solvent-mediated
influence also called the depletion force. The latter is more universal but also much more complex
to understand since it requires modeling both the nanoparticle and the solvent. Here, we employed
classical density functional theory to determine the forces acting on a nanoparticle near a
nanoscopic pore as a function of its hydrophobicity and its size. A simple capillary model is constructed
to predict those depletion forces for various surface properties. For a nanoscopic pore,
complexity arises from both the specific geometry and the fact that hydrophobic pores are not
necessarily filled with liquid. Taking all of these effects into account and including electrostatic effects,
we establish a phase diagram describing the entrance and the rejection of the nanoparticle

Different  synthesis methodologies for CeO2 nanoparticles and functionalization schemes of nanoparticle surfaces were evaluated using ex-situ and in-situ methodologies. For NC films synthesis, direct mixing and solvent evaporation were used in different protocols of nanoparticles incorporation on polymer matrix, remarking the protocol based on phase transfer, using palmitic acid (C16H32O2) as a ligand of CeO2 nanoparticles. To characterize the properties of the samples produced, thermogravimetry (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), infrared absorption spectrum (FTIR), and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were carried out. The PMMA/CeO2 NC films were compared with pure PMMA films, indicating that, thermally, the NC maintains the main characteristics of the PMMA matrix.

Here, we disperse gold, silver, cerium oxide, and positively-charged polystyrene nanoparticles in cell culture media, using the timing between mixing steps to control agglomerate size in otherwise identical media. These protein-stabilized dispersions are generally stable for at least two days, with mean agglomerate sizes of ∼23 nm silver nanoparticles ranging from 43–1400 nm and average relative standard deviations of less than 10%. Mixing rate, timing between mixing steps and nanoparticle concentration are shown to be critical for achieving reproducible dispersions. We characterize the size distributions of agglomerated nanoparticles by further developing dynamic light scattering theory and diffusion limited colloidal aggregation theory. These theories frequently affect the estimated size by a factor of two or more. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of controlling agglomeration by showing that large agglomerates of silver nanoparticles cause significantly less hemolytic toxicity than small agglomerates.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/2092dc39-ff80-4685-b58a-973aeb331b63/article.pdf,pdf

This paper addresses a computational and experimental study of complex F-type defect centers formed in YAG by doping with cerium and carbon. The formation energies determined by ab initio calculations of different defects and atomic chemical potentials in YAG:Ce,C are discussed in O-poor and O-rich conditions corresponding to the crystal growth under Ar+CO reducing atmosphere, and post-growth annealing in air. It is shown that as-grown crystals contain numerous positively charged defects responsible for F-type center formation, whereas mainly negative charged defects are remained after the annealing in air. The negatively charged defects located nearby Ce luminescence center occupying Y site may stabilize cerium in the tetravalent state and promote a hole transport to this luminescence center. This describes a high scintillation efficiency of Ce,C-doped garnets. Furthermore, YAG:C and YAG:Ce,C with a high carbon concentration, besides of luminescence peaked at 400 ns ascribed to F+-type centers, possess a fast luminescence peaked around 650 nm that may be attributed to the complex defect centers.

Most current survey tools are optimized for capturing individual rather than network-level data. Those that do capture network data are often tedious and cumbersome. Network Canvas is different. It helps you to capture data about both the individual and their social network through intuitive and engaging touch-optimized interfaces, in a co-production environment. By representing abstract relationships and attributes visually, complex structural data becomes more tangible and simple to capture.
Furthermore, a thorough understanding of population dynamics is vital for reducing the spread of infectious disease and for informing disease control, yet the collection, processing, and storage of complex network and contextual data poses enormous methodological challenges for researchers. Therefore, this project aims to address this clear need by developing and sustaining a relevant, customizable, and user-friendly software suite that simplifies the collection and management of complex structural data. Feedback from social and behavioral health researchers and others who have an interest in network data collection have informed the design and functionality of the suite at every stage of development.

A minute (10-8 mol dm-3) quantity of iodide mediated oxidation of arsenic(III) by cerium(IV) in an aqueous sulphuric acid and sulphate media has been studied spectrophotometrically at 25 °C. The stoichiometry is 1 : 2, i.e. one mole of arsenic(lll) requires two moles of cerium(IV). The reaction is first order each in cerium(IV) and iodide concentrations. The order with respect to arsenic(lll) is less than unity. Increase in sulphuric acid concentration increased the rate. In situ H+ ion concentration is calculated by the knowledge of equilibrium constants and the order with respect to H+ ion concentration is found to be less than unity. The ionic strength did not have any significant effect on the rate of reaction, whereas rate constant increased with decreasing dielectric constant of the medium. Added products cerium(lll) and arsenic(V) did not have any significant effect on the reaction rate. The active species of oxidant and reductant are Ce(SO4)2+ and Asl2+ respectively. A suitable mechanism is proposed. The catalytic constant and activation parameters are determined. The.results obtained in the present study are similar to that of bromide, chloride and iodide mediated oxidation of antimony(III) by cerium(IV) in aqueous sulphuric acid-sulfate media and are compared and discussed.

All synthesis technologies used are complex. The structural phase of yttrium-aluminum garnet is formed with any technology, at temperatures exceeding 1,500 °C. The starting materials for the synthesis are metal oxides of aluminum, yttrium and other oxides for activation and modification. It seems possible to use hard radiation to form a new phase. Radiation synthesis of ceramics is realized in less than 1 s, without the use of any additives and influences.
The synthesis was carried out at the electron accelerator of the Institute of Nuclear Physics (Novosibirsk). In this work, we studied the spectral-kinetic and quantitative characteristics of luminescence for the first time obtained by the method of radiation synthesis of ceramic samples of yttrium-aluminum garnet doped with cerium with statistical processing of their values. The dependences of the reproducibility of the spectral characteristics of the luminescence of the samples on the preliminary preparation of the charge for synthesis have been investigated. Several cycles of luminophore brightness studies have been performed.
It is shown that the obtained ceramics based on yttrium-aluminum garnet doped with cerium possesses the required spectral-kinetic properties, and the efficiency of conversion of the chip radiation into luminescence is achieved, which is comparable to that available in commercial phosphors. The maximum measured values of the position of the bands are from 553.5 to 559.6 nm. Brightness values range from 4,720 to 1,960 cd/m2.

Triflupromazine hydroclorlde Is proposed as a new reagent for tbe spectropbotometric determination of cerium(IV). The reagent forms red coloured species with cerium(IV) instantaneously in 2.5-4.0M phosphoric acid. The red species boa absorption maximum at 503 om with molar absorptivity 6.70 x 108 litre mole1 cm1. A twenty-fold molar excess of the reagent is necessary for the full development of the colour intensity. Beer's Jaw Is valid over the concentration range 0.4-14.20 ppm of cerium(IV) The effects of acid concentration, time, temperature, order of addition of reagents, reagent concentration and diverse ions are reported. The proposed method offers the advantages of simplicity, selectivity, rapidity and without the need for extraction.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/9c39765f-f20b-4269-927d-cb04c42eabc3/869-871.pdf,pdf

Polarographic behaviour of Ce(IV) and Ce(III) has been studied in alkaline N, N-dihydroxyethylglycine. The complexes formed with both the oxidation states of cerium are quite stable even at high pH. The complex species formed with both Ce(IV) and Ce(III) are the same and no change in half-wave potentials is noted on chang­ing the ligand concentration. The half-wave potential is very much pH dependent and the studies have been made at 0.2M to 1.0M hydroxyl ion concentrations. The waves, both cathodic and anodic, are fully reversible and are diffusion controlled. Three electrode reactions have been proposed depending upon the hydroxyl ion concentra­tions.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/740bfa46-a9e9-43b3-a25a-93da7eb29b2b/137-139.pdf,pdf

investigation of magneto hydrodynamic boundary layer flow of a
nanofluid past a wedge shaped wick in heat pipe used for the cooling
of electronic components and different type of machines. To
incorporate the effect of nanoparticle diameter, concentration of
nanoparticles in the pure fluid, nanothermal layer formed around the
nanoparticle and Brownian motion of nanoparticles etc., appropriate
models are used for the effective thermal and physical properties of
nanofluids. To model the rotation of nanoparticles inside the base
fluid, microfluidics theory is used. In this investigation ethylene
glycol (EG) based nanofluids, are taken into account. The non-linear
equations governing the flow and heat transfer are solved by using a
very effective particle swarm optimization technique along with
Runge-Kutta method. The values of heat transfer coefficient are
found for different parameters involved in the formulation viz.
nanoparticle concentration, nanoparticle size, magnetic field and
wedge angle etc. It is found that, the wedge angle, presence of
magnetic field, nanoparticle size and nanoparticle concentration etc.
have prominent effects on fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics

Although it remains insufficiently demonstrated, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) imaging is a promising tool for the characterization of biological complex systems. To this aim, a controllable 3D cell culture model which spans nearly 1 cm(2) in surface footprint is designed. This structure is composed of fibroblasts containing SERS-encoded nanoparticles (i.e., SERS tags), arranged in an alternating layered structure. This ""sandwich"" type structure allows monitoring of the SERS signals in the z-axis and with mm dimensions in the xy-axis. Taking advantage of correlative microscopy techniques such as electron microscopy, it is possible to corroborate nanoparticle positioning and distances in z-depths of up to 150 mu m. This study reveals a proof-of-concept method for detailed 3D SERS imaging of a complex, dense 3D cell culture model.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/83d8c42e-1ddd-4c42-b7b4-18911ff4cba1/adfm.201909655%281%29.pdf,pdf

However, in the former time, polyethylene glycol (PEG) was connected into phospholipid after the liposomes were already prepared. In this paper, we intend to study the possibility of applying phospholipids which already connected with PEG and then they were used to prepare liposomes. The model drug resveratrol was used because it can be applied against different diseases. Cholesterol was applied to stabilize the membrane of liposomes. The thin film technique in a laboratory scale was a preparation method. The liposomes were then characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) and light microscopic techniques. The stable liposomes can be produced and the particle sizes after filtration were in nanometers. The 2- and 3-chains-PEG-phospholipid (PL) caused in smaller particle size than the 4-chains-PEG-PL. Liposomes from PL 90G and cholesterol were stable during storage at 8 °C of 56 days because the particle sizes measured by PCS were almost not changed. There was almost no leakage of resveratrol from liposomes PL 90G with cholesterol after diffusion test in dialysis tube for 28 days. All liposomes showed the sustained release during measuring time of 270 min. The maximum release amount of 16-20% was detected with liposomes from 2- and 3-chains-PEG-PL. The other liposomes gave max. release amount of resveratrol only of 10%. The release kinetic can be explained by Korsmeyer-Peppas equation. ",https://zenodo.org/api/files/02a753f2-6ed9-4212-b6c8-c58560d7482c/10005614.pdf,pdf

Pre-sowing seed priming is a promising strategy to provide value-added solutions that influence the yield and quality of the seed. For selecting the appropriate doses of Ag-nanoparticle and GA3, three doses were taken for each chemical and eight genotypes of green gram were selected. The doses of Ag-nanoparticle were 10 ppm, 20 ppm and 50 ppm and for GA3 50 ppm, 100 ppm, 150 ppm. Eight genotypes of green gram were soaked with three doses each of GA3 and Ag-nanoparticle solution for 6 hours. The laboratory experiment was conducted in seed testing laboratory, BCKV, West Bengal during 2019. Germination percentage and vigor were observed to determine the changes in seed quality after priming with different doses GA3 and Ag-Nanoparticle. While considering treatments over genotypes for GA3, significantly highest germination percentage (99.16) and vigour index (2017.937) were observed when it was primed with 50 ppm GA3. In case of Ag-nanoparticle significantly highest germination percentage (99.31) and vigour index (2102.632) were recorded for 20 ppm, when the average was made over genotypes. So, Ag-Nanoparticle @ 20 ppm and GA3 @ 50 ppm were proved to be appropriate dose in green gram for quality seed production.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/5073a113-83cb-49d0-99a1-3fbbdf9b3b08/IJOEAR-APR-2021-7.pdf,pdf
