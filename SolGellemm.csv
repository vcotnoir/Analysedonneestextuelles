Sodium alginate sol can be converted into ionotropic gel through the diffusion of a di- or trivalent metal ion. The kinetics or this process can be studied by two different methods. The first is the analytical method in which the decrease of the divalent metal ion concentration with time during the exchange process with sodium alginate sol is followed complexometrically. It is found that the rate of gel formation is greater at first during the primary gel membrane formation, and it depends on both the electrolyte and the sol concentration. The rate then decreases during the further gel growth and becomes constant whatever the concentration or the electrolyte is. This may be attributed to the diffusion control through the primary gel membrane. The second method is the drop density method in which the rate of density variation or a sol drop during its contact with the electrolyte solution is taken as a measure or ionotropic gel growth. The drop density method is carried out at different temperatures, and the rate of growth is found to increase by raising temperature. The activation energy is calculated and found to have the values between (13-20 k.j./Mole).",https://zenodo.org/api/files/423cd866-0912-4025-b60d-89969e9130b8/728-731.pdf,pdf,"Chemistry Department , Faculty of Science , Sohag , Egypt

The aim of this research is to find out the quality of the thin film based on the number of cycles (3, 4, 5, and 6 cycles) and annealing temperature (300, 400 and 500 °C). The variation of annealing temperature and number of cycles can affect the crystal structure of the FTO thin film, crystal size and grain size. Increasing the number of cycles and annealing temperature can lead to larger crystallite size and lower dislocation density, so that electrons between the grains can move easily. The large grain can reduce the grain boundary, increasing the electron mobility and decreasing the resistivity. XRD analysis shows that the structure of SnO2 polycrystalline with the most dominant crystal plane (110) is formed in this research when compared to the intensity of other structures. The resistivity value decreases with increasing the annealing temperature and number of cycles. In addition, transparency value also decreases along with increasing the annealing temperature and number of cycles. The optimum results of resistivity and transparency values obtained in this research are 1.692´10-2 Ω×cm and 69.232 % at 500 °C and 5 cycles.

The prepared rice husk ash based magnetic hydrogel (RHA-MH) were used as a catalyst for H2 generation through hydrolysis of sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Factors effecting hydrolysis reaction such as effect of RHA calcination temperature and method used to synthesis the catalyst were investigated. The RHA-MH1200 synthesised via cross-linking and sol-gel methods (using RHA calcined at 1200°C) shows the shortest time taken (5.64 min and 11.18 min, respectively) to produce 40 mL of H2 gas as compared to RHA-MH600 (i.e. 10.47 min and 13.18 min respectively, for both methods using RHA calcined at 600°C). The prepared and spent RHA-MH were also characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)/Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. From SEM image, it could be concluded that silica (SiO2) could successfully be utilized as the supporting material for stabilizing magnetic iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles.

Glass-forming ability and structural features of melt-quenched and gel-derived SiO2-TiO2 glasses
Abstract
SiO2-TiO2 glasses produced by melt-quenching or sol-gel spray-drying were compared to highlight their structural differences. Glass formation was possible by melt-quenching up to 10 mol% TiO2, while higher contents led to devitrification. Raman spectroscopy and solid-state 17O and 29Si MAS NMR confirmed the clear emergence of Ti-O-Si bonds and a tetrahedral oxygen coordination of Ti4+ leading to full network connectivity, as also substantiated by the synthesis of TiO2-doped cristobalite. In gel-derived glasses, water content induced partial network depolymerization, thereby enhancing the solubility of TiO2 in the hydrous silicate matrix. However, full dehydration during heating proved challenging due to the competing devitrification tendency: the glass-forming range in the anhydrous binary SiO2-TiO2 system does not therefore appear to be significantly enlarged by the sol-gel synthesis route.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/eea7fbcb-fdfb-4cd8-bc2f-52d7c0d35650/Research%20Data%2C%20GCA%20SiO2-TiO2%20glasses.zip,zip,"research datum for Manuscript submission with title

The synthesis of bimetallic alkoxides has been followed by the preparation of intriguingly stable heterometal alkoxides containing three or four different metal atoms in the same molecular species, which has led to the possibility of molecularly designing a single source precursor suited to the composition of the targeted final ceramic. This has been made feasible by the extraordinary stability of the framework of heterometal alkoxides, which appears to remain intact during the initial hydrolysis reactions in the S-G process. The characterisation (by sophisticated physicochemical techniques including X-Ray crystal structure elucidation in some cases) of heterometal alkoxides appears to have added a new dimension to heterometal coordination systems which appear to be uniquely stable without the presence of metal-metal bonds or auxiliary ligands like CO, etc., enerally required for stabilising polymetallic systems known so far.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/13e62c80-2c02-409e-a6c0-8f765254e7a6/315-321.pdf,pdf,"University of Allahabad , allahabad-211 002

Moreover, these materials have been compared with individualised TiO2 nanoparticles prepared by a sol-gel procedure. CO and H2 are detected as major products with all photocatalysts, with lower amounts of CH4 and CH3OH.

The applications for tetraalkoxysilanes are classified roughly by whether the Si–OR bond is expected to remain intact or be hydrolyzed in the final application. Applications in which the Si–OR bond is hydrolyzed include as binders for foundry-mold sands used in investment and thin-shell castings; as binders for refractories; and as resins, coatings, sol–gel glasses, cross-linking agents, and adhesion promoters. Applications in which the Si–OR bond remains intact include as heat-transfer and hydraulic fluids. The hydrolysis reaction, which yields polymers of silicic acid that can be dehydrated to silicon dioxide, is of considerable commercial importance. The chemistry and properties of alkoxysilanes and related acyloxysilanes and aspects of commercial production and utilization are reviewed. Sol–gel technology is discussed.

                    Background: Micro-texturing is an increasingly used technique that aims at improving the functional behaviour of components during their useful life, and it is applied in different industrial manufacturing processes for different purposes, such as reducing friction on dynamic rubber seals for pneumatic equipment, among others. Micro-texturing is produced on polymer components by transfer from the mould and might critically increase the adhesion and friction between the moulded rubber part with the mould, provoking issues during demoulding, both on the mould itself and on the rubber part. The mould design, the coating release agent applied to the mould surface, and the operational parameters of the moulding/demoulding process, are fundamental aspects to avoid problems and guarantee a correct texture transfer during the demoulding process. 
                    Methods: In this work, the lack of knowledge about demoulding processes was addressed with an in-house test rig and a robust experimental procedure to measure demoulding forces (DFs) as well as the final quality of the moulded part, between thermoset polymers and moulds. After the characterization of several Sol-Gel coating formulations (inorganic; hybrid) the influence of several parameters was analysed experimentally, i.e.: Sol-Gel efficiency, texture effects, pattern geometry, roughness and material compound. 
                    Results: The results obtained from the experimental studies revealed that texture depth is the most critical geometrical parameter, showing high scatter among the selected compounds. Finally, the experimental results were used to compute a model through reduced order modelling (ROM) technique for the prediction of DFs. 
                    Conclusions: The characterization of DFs in a laboratory, with a specific device operated by a universal testing machine (UTM), provided valuable information that allows a fast and optimized introduction of texturing in rubber components.
