In the present study, a flow cytometric based approach to evaluate the toxicity of graphene family of nanomaterials (GFNs) to mammalian cells will be presented. Briefly, to evaluate cell-nanoparticles interactions, several cell models were exposed to different concentrations of GFNs and analysed by flow cytometry after 24h or 48h. Endpoints include nanoparticle cell uptake (FSC/SSC), intracellular ROS formation (DCFH2-DA), inflammatory potential by cytokine estimation using cytometric bead arrays, induction of apoptosis using FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit and evaluation of cell cycle dynamics.

Rasheed",2021-04-01,"The plasmonic material properties of aluminum allow active plasmon resonances extending from the blue color in the visible range to the ultraviolet (UV) region of the spectrum. Whereas Al is usually avoided for applications of plasmonics due to its losses in the infrared spectrum region. In this work, the study of the scatter and absorption of disk nanoantennas (DNAs) using various types of materials Au, Ag, and Al is accomplished by using the CST microwave studio suite simulation. The results showed that Al can offer good plasmonic properties when DNA radius is 25 nm to 125 nm at 20 nm height and working wavelengths longer than 800 nm in the near-infrared (NIR) region. Al produces negative plasmonic features around 800 nm wavelength due to the interband transition in the imaginary part of epsilon. For Au and Ag, the plasmonic characteristics rapidly decayed when the DNA radius was higher than 60 nm, but in contrast, Al offers good plasmonic features at these large dimensions of DNAs. This extended response of Al in UV, visible, and NIR, incorporated with its low cost, natural abundance, low native oxide, and amenability to industrial processes, could make Al an extremely promising plasmonic metal candidate for energy applications.

12,Magnetic control of particle trapping in a hybrid plasmonic nanopore,10.1063/5.0046245,"Maccaferri N, Vavassori P., Garoli D.",2021-05-11,"Plasmonic nanopores are extensively investigated as single molecules detectors. The main limitations in plasmonic nanopore technology are the too fast translocation velocity of the molecule through the pore and the consequent very short analysis times, as well as the possible instabilities due to local heating. An interesting approach to enable longer acquisition times is represented by the ability to stably trap the nanoparticles used to tag molecules close to the nanopore. Here, we theoretically investigate the performance of a magneto-plasmonic nanopore prepared with a thin layer of cobalt sandwiched between two gold layers. A nanopore is then coupled with a bifunctional (magnetic and plasmonic) core–shell nanoparticle made of magnetite (core) covered with a thin layer of gold (shell). By setting the magnetic configuration of the cobalt layer around the pore by an external magnetic field, it is possible to generate a nanoscale magnetic tweezer to trap the nanoparticle at a specific point. Considering a 10nm diameter magnetite nanoparticle, we calculate a trapping force up to 28 pN, an order of magnitude above the force that can be obtained with standard optical or plasmonic trapping approaches. Moreover, the magnetic force pulls the nanoparticle in close contact with the plasmonic nanopore’s wall, thus enabling the formation of a nanocavity enclosing a sub-10nm3 confined

A milestone in the field has been the development of the so-called seed-mediated growth method, a synthetic route that provided access to an extraordinary diversity of metal nanoparticles with tailored size, geometry and composition. Such a morphological control came along with an exquisite definition of the optical response of plasmonic nanoparticles, thereby increasing their prospects for implementation in various fields. The susceptibility of surface plasmons to respond to small changes in the surrounding medium or to perturb (enhance/quench) optical processes in nearby molecules, has been exploited for a wide range of applications, from biomedicine to energy harvesting. However, the possibilities offered by plasmonic nanoparticles can be expanded even further by their careful assembly into either disordered or ordered structures, in 2D and 3D. The assembly of plasmonic nanoparticles gives rise to coupling/hybridization effects, which are strongly dependent on interparticle spacing and orientation, generating extremely high electric fields (hot spots), confined at interparticle gaps. Thus, the use of plasmonic nanoparticle assemblies as optical sensors have led to improving the limits of detection for a wide variety of (bio)molecules and ions.

Nevertheless, a fundamental and mechanistic understanding of the effects of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation on enzyme regulation remains elusive. We herein investigate the plasmonic effects on biocatalysis using Au nanospheres (AuNSp) and nanostars (AuNSt) as model plasmonic nanoparticles, lipase from Candida antarctica fraction B (CALB) as a proof-of-concept enzyme, and 808 nm as near-infrared light excitation. Our data show that LSPR excitation enables an enhancement of 58% in the enzyme activity for CALB adsorbed on AuNSt, compared with the dark conditions. This work shows how photothermal heating over the LSPR excitation enhances the CALB activity through favoring product release in the last step of the enzyme mechanism.

Although this effect has been already used to modulate plasmonic resonances in nanophotonics, it has not been fully examined for the two materials chosen in this work — vanadium dioxide (VO2) and iron-rhodium alloy (FeRh). Plasmonic resonances can be described as resonances of electromagnetic field in metallic nanostructures. With these nanostructures we are even able to modulate light. In this thesis, we firstly optimized electron beam lithography process for production of metal nanodiscs with 40–200 nm diameters. Secondly, we measured an optical response of gold nanodiscs to better understand the nature of their plasmonic resonances and interactions between them. Lastly, we described the optimization of polycrystalline VO2 growth and measured optical responses of VO2 and FeRh nanodiscs during their respective phase transitions. Our observation of Mie’s resonances in the dielectric phase of the VO2 nanodiscs suggests, that they have a potential to act as tunable plasmonic resonators which switch from Mie’s resonances in the dielectric phase into plasmonic resonances in the metallic one. When measuring the FeRh nanodiscs, we observed plasmonic resonances in the visible part of the spectrum.

Metal nanoparticles have the ability to confine the collective oscillation of electrons, which is called localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). In this work, silver nanoparticles have been proposed to enhance light harvesting, which could be useful for different applications. Metal nanoparticles such as gold and silver nanoparticles have the ability to concentrate field in a very small space. In this study, gold and silver nanoparticles optical response was investigated using frequency domain simulation. The resonance wavelength of gold and silver nanoparticles was about 550 nm and 400 nm, respectively.
Silver nanoparticles showed better LSPR performance than gold nanoparticles. Therefore, silver nanoparticles were chosen for optical field enhancement. Here silver nanoparticles were placed on a silicon substrate for optical field enhancement. To study the effect of size on the optical response of silver nanoparticles, the optical properties of this structure with different silver nanoparticles diameter values were investigated. Silver nanoparticles with 40 nm diameters showed a better optical response. To study the effect of the distance between silver nanoparticles on the optical response, different gap values were put between silver nanoparticles. The gap value of 4 nm showed a better optical response. The obtained results showed that the localized field is strongly dependent on the metal type, size, and space between nanoparticles. In addition, the optical field concentration can be controlled by tuning the size and space between silver nanoparticles. This will support localized field enhancement.

In this work, we take advantage of the remarkable mechanical properties of graphene to combine it with scalable 3D plasmonic nanostructured silicon substrates, which enhance the interaction of graphene with electromagnetic radiation. Large areas of femtosecond laser-structured arrays of silicon nanopillars, decorated with gold nanoparticles, are integrated with graphene, which conforms to the substrate nanotopography. We obtain Raman spectra at 488, 514, 633, and 785 nm excitation wavelengths, spanning the entire visible range. For all excitation wavelengths, the Raman signal of graphene is enhanced by 2–3 orders of magnitude, similarly to the highest enhancements measured to date, concerning surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) of graphene on plasmonic substrates.

One of the most problematic areas is that there is still no unambiguous answer to which main copper monosulfide nanoparticles parameters have a decisive effect on their resonance absorption, scattering or electric field enhancement. It is necessary to study the plasmonic properties of copper monosulfide nanoparticles depending on their main parameter, namely the dielectric constant. The principle of dipole equivalence and Mee-Gans theory for the modeling of the optical nanoparticle characteristics is used. It is found that dielectric constant is a crucial parameter determining the resulting optical response of such nanoparticles. The surrounding medium refractive index affects the position and magnitude of the nanoparticles maximum plasmonic absorption. The nonspherical nanoparticles are characterized by two plasmon peaks corresponding to transverse and longitudinal localized surface plasmon resonance if the ratio between the axes is higher than 1.5. The ellipsoidal nanoparticles exhibit higher sensitivity to changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium in comparison to the spherical ones.

Here, we experimentally demonstrate that suitably self-assembled achiral plasmonic nanostructures produce a high degree of enhancement in the optical dichroism observed from chiral molecules placed in their vicinity. Specifically, we identify a near-field enhancement associated with plasmonic hotpots as the mechanism enabling our observation of visible-NIR circular dichroism emanating from small amounts of chiral molecules. Our structures consist of linear arrays of gold nanorods obtained by introducing chiral anionic surfactants, such as modified bile salts, which lead to selective destabilization of a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide coating layer on Au nanorods, thereby promoting a tip-to-tip oriented assembly. The proposed mechanism of plasmonically-enhanced circular dichroism is supported by deriving a simple, yet general theoretical formalism that confirms the observed results, revealing the role of optical hotspots at the gaps of linear tip-to-tip nanorod assemblies as the origin of enhancement in the dichroism from chiral molecules. Importantly, it is the refractive rather than the absorption-mediated chiral response of the molecules that produces dichroism in the visible-NIR plasmonic regime, far from their UV absorption resonances.

The position of the gold plasmon band in the UV-Visible spectrum depends on the size and shape of gold nanoparticles as well as on the surrounding environment. By adsorbing various chemical entities, or binding them, the gold plasmon band will shift toward longer wavelengths and the shift is proportional to the concentration. Exosomes transport cargoes of molecules and genetic materials to proximal and distal cells. Presently, the standard method for their isolation and quantification from body fluids is by ultracentrifugation, not a practical method to be implemented in a clinical setting. Thus, a versatile and cutting-edge platform is required to selectively detect and isolate exosomes for further analysis at clinical level. The new sensing protocol, instead of antibodies, makes use of a specially synthesized polypeptide (Vn96), to capture and quantify the exosomes from different media, by binding the heat shock proteins from exosomes. The protocol has been established and optimized by using a glass substrate, in order to facilitate the next stage, namely the transfer of the protocol to a microfluidic environment. After each step of the protocol, the UV-Vis spectrum was recorded and the position of gold Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) band was measured. The sensing process was modelled, taking into account the characteristics of the nano-island structure, prepared by thermal convection and annealing. The optimal molar ratios of the most important chemical entities, involved in the detection of exosomes were calculated as well. Indeed, it was found that the results of the sensing process depend on the two major steps: the molar ratios of streptavidin to biotin-PEG-Vn96 and, the final step, the capture of exosomes by the biotin-PEG-Vn96 complex. The microfluidic device designed for sensing of exosomes consists of a glass substrate, sealed by a PDMS layer that contains the channel and a collecting chamber. In the device, the solutions of linker, cross-linker, etc., are pumped over the gold nano-islands and an Ocean Optics spectrometer is used to measure the position of the Au plasmon band at each step of the sensing. The experiments have shown that the shift of the Au LSPR band is proportional to the concentration of exosomes and, thereby, exosomes can be accurately quantified.

The hybrid device is constructed by coupling a doublet of V-shaped gold plasmonic nanoantennas on top of the indium phosphide waveguide. By taking advantage of the localized surface plasmons, our hybrid device can enable detection of the magnetization state in magnetic bits beyond the diffraction limit of light and enhance the polar magneto-optical Kerr effect (PMOKE). We further illustrate how combining the hybrid device with a plasmonic polarization rotator provides magneto-optical read-out by transforming the PMOKE-induced polarization change into an intensity variation of the waveguide mode. According to the simulation results based on a three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method, the hybrid device can detect the magnetization states in targeted bits in a magnetic racetrack medium down to ~100×100 nm 2 , regardless of the magnetization state of the rest of the racetrack with a relative intensity contrast of greater than 0.5% for a ~200×100 nm 2 magnetic bit.

Close-packed colloidal supercrystals not only serve for investigating the rich plasmonic resonances arising in strongly coupled arrangements, but also enables tailoring the optical response, on both the nano- and the macroscale. Bridging these vastly different length scales at reasonable fabrication costs has remained fundamentally challenging, but is essential for applications in sensing, photovoltaics or optoelectronics, among other fields. We present here a scalable approach to engineer plasmonic supercrystal arrays, based on the template-assisted assembly of gold nanospheres with topographically patterned polydimethylsiloxane molds.

Krenn",2020-12-18,"We use cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy in a transmission electron microscope to probe the radial breathing mode of plasmonic silver nanodisks. A two-mirror detection system sandwiching the sample collects the CL emission in both directions, that is, backward and forward with respect to the electron beam trajectory. We unambiguously identify a spectral shift of about 8 nm in the CL spectra acquired from both sides and show that this asymmetry is induced by the electron beam itself. By numerical simulations, we confirm the observations and identify the underlying physical effect due to the interference of the CL emission patterns of an electron-beam-induced dipole and the breathing mode. This effect can ultimately limit the achievable fidelity in CL measurements on any system involving multiple excitations and should therefore be considered with care in high-precision experiments.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/6ecdb5c0-4a8f-4893-8056-96f3d0dc5ee9/acs.nanolett.0c04084-Hor%C3%A1k2021.pdf,pdf,"we use cathodoluminescence ( CL ) spectroscopy in a transmission electron microscope to probe the radial breathing mode of plasmonic silver nanodisk . a two - mirror detection system sandwich the sample collect the CL emission in both direction , that is , backward and forward with respect to the electron beam trajectory . we unambiguously identify a spectral shift of about 8 nm in the CL spectra acquire from both side and show that this asymmetry be induce by the electron beam itself . by numerical simulation , we confirm the observation and identify the underlie physical effect due to the interference of the CL emission pattern of an electron - beam - induce dipole and the breathing mode . this effect can ultimately limit the achievable fidelity in CL measurement on any system involve multiple excitation and should therefore be consider with care in high - precision experiment ."
