After stabilizing the coating slurries, double layers consisting of a bond coat applied by dip coating and a top coat with passive fillers deposited by spray coating were prepared on stainless steel substrates. After thermal treatment in air at 800 °C, uniform and crack-free composite coatings on stainless steel with a thickness up to 90 μm were prepared. The high temperature oxidation behavior of coated and uncoated samples in atmosphere of synthetic air was investigated at the temperatures up to 1000 °C.

1,Probabilistic and Sensitive Analysis of the Secondary Air System of a Two-Spool Engine,10.5281/zenodo.1344966,"Deng, Shuangguo, Wang, Daijun, Chen, Xiao",2018-08-14,"The present investigation aims at performing a probabilistic and sensitive analysis of a secondary air system for a two-spool engine. Through this analysis, the robust of secondary air system could be gained and the most sensitive geometric parameters are found. Furthermore, the more restrict mechanical tolerance could be demanded by the designer of secondary air system.
An in-house code called ASUS was developed for probabilistic and sensitive analysis, which is based on Monte Carlo Simulation method (MCS). The analysis model was based on the deterministic secondary air system network for a two-spool engine with take-off condition with all geometric parameters, including seals, gaps, holes and tubes. These parameters were normally distributed based on the real geometric tolerances to form the probabilistic inputs. The boundary condition was treated in two ways; one is constant while the other is normally distributed with an assumed change range ±5%. Probabilistic and sensitive analyses were carried out on these two cases. Through the analyses, in both cases the rim seal after 1st rotor is sensitive to the mechanical tolerance and boundary change. Therefore, the special attention should be paid to this flow path.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/5e2267c7-24c8-4a48-ba7b-4075bb840ece/GPPS-NA-2018-0080.pdf,pdf

been used to characterize the oxide layer thickness, surface
morphology, oxide layer-substrate adhesion and porosity. In the first
experiment, samples modified by thermal oxidation process then
followed by electrochemical anodizing. Second experiment consists
of surfaces modified by electrochemical anodizing process and then
followed by thermal oxidation. The first method shows better
properties than other one. In second experiment, Surfaces modified
were achieved by thicker and more adherent thick oxide layers on
titanium surface. The existence of an electrochemical anodized oxide

3,The Role of Thermally Grown Oxide in the Failure Thermal Barrier Coatings for Gas Turbine Engine Applications,10.5281/zenodo.1345001,"Pankov, Vladimir, Patnaik, Prakash C., Chen, Kuiying",2018-05-07,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are widely used in gas turbine engines for propulsion and power generation to maximize engine operating temperature and fuel efficiency. TBCs comprise primarily three major components: the ceramic top coat, the intermetallic bond coat and a thin layer of a thermally grown oxide (TGO) formed at the bond coat/top coat interface. It was demonstrated that the TGO layer plays a critical role in determining the TBC life time with many TBC failure events occurring with its direct involvement. However, the actual mechanisms that govern TBC degradation and failure are still not fully understood in terms of the TGO role and the effects of its properties on the failure process. Stress analysis and TBC life time modelling were used in this study to demonstrate that the TGO morphology, its specific mechanical and thermal properties significantly affect the degradation modes and failure behaviour of the entire TBC system while the particular failure mechanisms differ depending on the ceramic top coat fabrication process. In this paper, the effect of changes in the TGO layer during thermal cycling has been theoretically investigated for TBC with top coats fabricated by atmospheric plasma spray and electron be am physical vapour deposition and the differences in their degradation and failure have been discussed.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/fb2d69f8-3a81-43d8-ab66-622aafb7761a/GPPS-NA-2018-0161.pdf,pdf

7,Improved Air Processability of Organic Photovoltaics Using a Stabilizing Antioxidant to Prevent Thermal Oxidation,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c07050,"Steinberger, Marc, Distler, Andreas, Brabec, Christoph J., Egelhaaf, Hans-Joachim",2021-12-21,"During the production of organic solar cells, the exposure of constituting materials and resulting devices to light, heat, oxygen and water is a potential source of degradation. We show that thermo-oxidation of the active materials occurs upon annealing the active layer or upon stirring the active materials solutions in air at elevated temperatures. By comparing various blends of donor polymers with fullerene or non-fullerene acceptors, the fullerene is identified to be the most susceptible component to thermal oxidation in both film and solution, while the polymer remains unaffected. In both cases, the effect on the photovoltaic device performance consists predominantly in a decreased short-circuit current (JSC), suggesting that the underlying degradation mechanism is the same in the solid state and in solution. In addition, we find that thermo-oxidation of the active layer during annealing of the device can be decelerated by blending nickel(II) dibutyldithiocarbamate (Ni(dtc)2) as antioxidant additive into the active layer. While small concentrations of additive stabilize the JSC and therefore the power conversion efficiency, higher contents negatively affect device performance. On the other hand, thermo-oxidation of the active materials in solution during stirring in air at elevated temperatures can be avoided for several hours by adding as little as 0.5% of Ni(dtc)2. The observation that the antioxidant is consumed during stabilization of the active materials suggests a sacrificial protection mechanism.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/79b34e74-fb9d-4912-9915-9a127583cde7/Steinberger%2C%20Improved%20air%20Processability%20of%20Organic%20Photovoltaics%2C%20JPC%20C%20126%282022%2922.pdf,pdf

This work investigates the potential of NiO-CeO2 nano-catalyst in CWAO of paper industry wastewater under milder operating conditions of 90 °C and 1 atm. The NiO-CeO2 nano-catalysts were synthesized by a simple co-precipitation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), before and after use, in order to study any crystallographic change during experiment. The extent of metal-leaching from the catalyst was determined using the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The catalytic activity of nano-catalysts was studied in terms of total organic carbon (TOC), adsorbable organic halides (AOX) and chlorophenolics (CHPs) removal. Interestingly, mixed oxide catalysts exhibited higher activity than the corresponding single-metal oxides. The maximum removal efficiency was achieved with Ce40Ni60 catalyst.

Advanced oxidation based techniques can be less efficient as standalone options and a hybrid approach by combining Hydrodynamic Cavitation (HC), and Wet Air Oxidation (WAO) can lead to a synergistic effect since both the options are based on common free radical mechanism. The HC can be used for initial turbulence and generation of hotspots which can begin the free radical attack and this agitating mixture then can be subjected to less intense WAO since initial heat (to raise the activation energy) can be taken care by HC alone. Lab-scale venturi-based hydrodynamic cavitation and wet air oxidation reactor with biomethanated distillery wastewater (BMDWW) as a model effluent was examined for establishing the proof-of-concept. The results indicated that for a desirable biodegradability index (BOD: COD - BI) enhancement (up to 0.4), the Cavitation (standalone) pretreatment condition was: 5 bar and 88 min reaction time with a COD reduction of 36 % and BI enhancement of up to 0.27 (initial BI - 0.17). The optimum WAO condition (standalone) was: 150oC, 6 bar and 30 minutes with 31% COD reduction and 0.33 BI. The hybrid pretreatment (combined Cavitation + WAO) worked out to be 23.18 min HC (at 5 bar) followed by 30 min WAO at 150oC, 6 bar, at which around 50% COD was retained yielding a BI of 0.55.

The thermal analysis of Fe(II), Fe(III), Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) chelates of 2'- hydroxy-4-methoxy-5'-methylchalkone oxime (HMMCO) was studied by TG and DTA techniques. All chelates show somewhat similar TG and DTA profiles when heated in an atmosphere of air. A sharp exothermic peak in the range 150-200° was observed preceded to endothermic peak for dehydration of metal chelate. This sharp exothermic peak may be caused due to the transition from unstable state to stable state of the chelate. Broad exothermic peak was observed above 300°, corresponding to rapid mass-loss in TG curve, which may be due to oxidation-reduction reactions. A relative thermal stability of metal chelates is reported.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/d3900ae7-19b3-4e36-882f-eee202874722/385-387.pdf,pdf

The results of the laboratory proved that in the formation of Red Oil, 1,3butadiene and acetaldehyde followed free radical and aldol condensation mechanism respectively. By increasing the injection rate of DMDS, Mercaptide amount increases in the effluent. In addition, pyrolysis gasoline accumulation is directly related to caustic concentration in the tower.

The fracture toughness of β–NiAl decreased during thermal cycling due to the depletion in Al, whereas the fracture toughness and the composition of α–Cr stayed constant. Since the fracture toughness of α–Cr was lower compared to β–NiAl, the formation of α–Cr precipitates is supposed to decrease the fracture toughness of the bond coat.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/eab099d0-db3e-4a7a-b918-d7bfb8f9f068/AdvEngMater-2022-Gabel-MicrocantileverFractureTestsofAlpha-CrContainingNiAlBondCoatsSupplementary.pdf,pdf

The import of materials, equipment, processing, and property aspects of key coatings within the energy trade, particularly the developments in gas turbine industries. Publications related to the machining of nickel-based superalloys (yet a challenge) as tool wear and also the mechanisms accountable for tool failure are recognized and named. The wholeness of the machined surfaces and tool life are the main necessary concerns throughout machining. The factors governing the machinability of nickel-based superalloys are mainly affected by notching of the tool, primarily at the depth of cut region, even as by flank wear and insert breaking fracture. The failure mode is caused by differentiation or conjugation, mechanical and thermal fatigue of the cutting tool additionally due to the mechanism of wear by decomposition. Recently developed tool materials such as composite compounds, Set Whisker reinforced corundum ceramics, Ceylon and multi-layer coated carbide compound tool tools with standard cemented carbide compound tools good for machine nickel-based superalloys in high-speed conditions Feedback is displayed.

A computational fluid dynamics model is developed to examine the air flow characteristics of a room with different supply air diffusers. The work focuses on air flow patterns, thermal behavior in the room with few number of occupants. As an input to the full-scale 3-D room model, a 2-D air supply diffuser model that supplies direction and magnitude of air flow into the room is developed. Air distribution effect on thermal comfort parameters was investigated depending on changing the air supply diffusers type, angles and velocity. Air supply diffusers locations and numbers were also investigated. The pre-processor Gambit is used to create the geometric model with parametric features. Commercially available simulation software ""Fluent 6.3"" is incorporated to solve the differential equations governing the conservation of mass, three momentum and energy in the processing of air flow distribution. Turbulence effects of the flow are represented by the well-developed two equation turbulence model.

The microstructural evolutions and coating thickness (CT) were studied upon the variation of processing conditions i.e. time and temperature. The results demonstrated (under identical conditions) that coating formed on pure Ni contains no substrate entrapments and have lower CT in comparison to one deposited on the CMSX-4 counterpart. In addition, the interdiffusion zone (IDZ) of Ni substrate is a γ’-Ni3Al in comparison to the CMSX-4 alloy that is βNiAl phase. The higher CT on CMSX-4 superalloy is attributed to presence of γ-Ni/γ’-Ni3Al structure which contains ~ 15 at.% Al before deposition (that is already present in superalloy). Two main deposition parameters (time and temperature) of the coatings were also studied in addition to standard comparison of substrate effects. The coating formation time was found to exhibit profound effect on CT, whilst temperature was found to change coating activities. In addition, the CT showed linear trend from 800 to 1000 °C, thereafter reduction was observed.

Asadullah",2020-03-30,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBC’s) are used to provide both thermal insulation and oxidation protection to high temperature components within gas turbines. The development of turbines for power generation and aviation has led to designs where the operation conditions exceed the upper limits of most conventional engineering materials. As a result, there has been a drive to improve thermal barrier coatings to allow the turbine to operate at higher temperatures for longer. The focus of this project is on thermal barrier coatings with lower conductivity and longer lifetime than those coatings used in industry today. The route taken to achieve these goals with APS TBC’s has been twofold.
Firstly, an alternative stabilizer has been chosen for the zirconium oxide system in the form of yttria (Yttrium oxide, also known as yttria, is Y2O3. It is an air-stable, white solid substance. Yttrium oxide is used as a common starting material for both materials science as well as inorganic compounds). Secondly, variations in thickness of coating. The focus of the work has therefore been to characterize their lifetime and thermal properties when produced in a complete TBC system.
In earlier work yttria stabilized zirconia was used only for a particular thickness value. In this work different values of thickness are used for topcoat and characterization of this coated material is determined. While small at room temperature and in the as produced state; the influence becomes more pronounced at high temperatures and with longer thermal exposure time. The thermal barrier coated specimen of varying thickness was tested at both steady and transient conditions. There were many parameters being evaluated like hardness, surface roughness, microstructure and temperature gradient and stress distributions in the specimen. The temperature gradient was determined both under steady state and transient conditions experimentally as well as computationally using ANSYS V17. ",https://zenodo.org/api/files/7d95efd3-ed2b-474b-b2f7-34a1c0cae20d/GJETA-2020-0010.pdf,pdf

Solar energy is one of the cornerstones for the world’s economic growth because of its abundancy with zero carbon pollution. Among the various solar energy conversion technologies, solar thermal technology has attracted a substantial renewed interest due to its diversity and compatibility in various applications. Solar thermal systems employ concentrators, tracking systems and heat engines for electricity generation which lead to high cost and complexity in comparison with photovoltaics; however, it is compatible with distinct thermal energy storage capability and dispatchable electricity which creates a tremendous attraction. Apart from that, employing cost-effective solar selective receiver tube in a concentrating solar thermal (CST) system improves the energy conversion efficiency and directly reduces the cost of technology. In addition, the development of solar receiver tubes by low cost methods which can offer high optical properties and corrosion resistance in an open-air atmosphere would be beneficial for low and medium temperature applications. In this regard, our work opens up an approach which has the potential to achieve cost-effective energy conversion. We have developed a highly selective tandem absorber coating through a facile wet chemical route by a combination of chemical oxidation, sol-gel, and nanoparticle coating methods. The developed tandem absorber coating has gradient refractive index nature on stainless steel (SS 304) and exhibited high optical properties (α ≤ 0.95 & ε ≤ 0.14). The first absorber layer (Cr-Mn-Fe oxides) developed by controlled oxidation of SS 304 in a chemical bath reactor. A second composite layer of ZrO2-SiO2 has been applied on the chemically oxidized substrate by So-gel dip coating method to serve as optical enhancing and corrosion resistant layer. Finally, an antireflective layer (MgF2) has been deposited on the second layer, to achieve > 95% of absorption. The developed tandem layer exhibited good thermal stability up to 250 °C in open air atmospheric condition and superior corrosion resistance (withstands for > 200h in salt spray test (ASTM B117)). After the successful development of a coating with targeted properties at a laboratory scale, a prototype of the 1 m tube has been demonstrated with excellent uniformity and reproducibility. Moreover, it has been validated under standard laboratory test condition as well as in field condition with a comparison of the commercial receiver tube. The presented strategy can be widely adapted to develop highly selective coatings for a variety of CST applications ranging from hot water, solar desalination, and industrial process heat and power generation.

49,Comparison of Different Gas Turbine Inlet Air Cooling Methods,10.5281/zenodo.1057711,"Ana Paula P. dos Santos, Claudia R. Andrade, Edson L. Zaparoli",2012-01-26,"Gas turbine air inlet cooling is a useful method for
increasing output for regions where significant power demand and
highest electricity prices occur during the warm months. Inlet air
cooling increases the power output by taking advantage of the gas
turbine-s feature of higher mass flow rate when the compressor inlet
temperature decreases. Different methods are available for reducing
gas turbine inlet temperature. There are two basic systems currently
available for inlet cooling. The first and most cost-effective system is
evaporative cooling. Evaporative coolers make use of the evaporation
of water to reduce the gas turbine-s inlet air temperature. The second
system employs various ways to chill the inlet air. In this method, the
cooling medium flows through a heat exchanger located in the inlet
duct to remove heat from the inlet air. However, the evaporative
cooling is limited by wet-bulb temperature while the chilling can cool
the inlet air to temperatures that are lower than the wet bulb
temperature. In the present work, a thermodynamic model of a gas
turbine is built to calculate heat rate, power output and thermal
efficiency at different inlet air temperature conditions. Computational
results are compared with ISO conditions herein called ""base-case"".
Therefore, the two cooling methods are implemented and solved for
different inlet conditions (inlet temperature and relative humidity).
Evaporative cooler and absorption chiller systems results show that
when the ambient temperature is extremely high with low relative
humidity (requiring a large temperature reduction) the chiller is the
more suitable cooling solution. The net increment in the power output
as a function of the temperature decrease for each cooling method is
also obtained.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/3899236a-2dd4-4126-9ece-562e1f945d0c/2686.pdf,pdf

The main aim of the present work was to evaluate the seasonal performance of three air-cooling systems in terms of air quality, thermal comfort and energy consumption in a standard classroom. Several annual energy simulations were carried out to evaluate these indexes for four different climate zones in the Mediterranean area.

The results showed that DRIEC and DX improved by 29.8% and 14.6% over RIEC regarding thermal comfort, for the warmest climatic conditions, Lampedusa and Seville. However, DX showed an energy consumption three and four times higher than DRIEC for these climatic conditions, respectively. RIEC provided the highest percentage of hours with favorable indoor air quality for all climate zones, between 46.3% and 67.5%.

A solution to the problem of increasing the adhesion strength by using pulsation of the atomizing air flow is proposed. At the optimal frequency of the pulsed flow shut-off, the time of formation of liquid metal droplets at the ends of the electrodes coincides with the frequency of pulses of the spraying flow. As a result, the droplets acquire an optimal size, they are transported by an air flow with conservation of energy, a lower mass of oxygen and, as a consequence, a significant decrease in the oxidation of alloying elements in the sprayed material. The existing test methods of sprayed coatings for adhesion strength to the base are analyzed. The design of a modernized device for determining the adhesion strength is developed and described, which provides complex loading of the coating with a combination of tear-off and shear. The tests revealed a significant (up to two times) increase in the adhesion strength of aluminum, zinc-aluminum and steel (Sv08A) coatings applied with air pulsation. This is achieved by increasing the number of fusion zones of the coating particles between themselves and with the base. It is shown that the effect of the pulsation frequency on the adhesion strength changes along a curve with a maximum corresponding to a frequency of 70–80 Hz, regardless of the coating material. It has been established that the aluminum coating has an increased tendency to oxidation, as a result of which it is 15–20 % inferior to the zinc-aluminum coating in adhesion strength.

The order of reactions and activation energy associated with the thermal decomposition of Cr-inoculated liver tissue and control liver tissue of chick embryo have been obtained by thermogravimetric methods in absence and presence of nitrogen atmosphere. In the temperature range of 25° to about 1100°, the differential thermogram has yielded four distinct peaks for these samples. However, the fourth peak has disappeared in nitrogen atmosphere. The thermal decomposition corresponding to each peak has been analysed and activation energy estimated accordingly. The peak temperature associated with the first peak decreases as the water content in the sample increases. The first and the second peaks correspond to losses of water and protein, respectively. The third and fourth peaks have been identified for mucopolysaccharide and due to oxidation in presence of air at high temperature, respectively. These decomposition behaviours are similar to the collagen content in liver tissues.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/c50fa6d1-9736-4d75-abe8-eb197f9078e4/20-22.pdf,pdf

The results of the thermal study showed that solar air heaters are capable of providing a sufficient increase in air temperature under the majority of crop drying circumstances studied. The restricted thermal capacity of air, as well as the low heat transfer coefficient between the absorber plate and the air flow via the ducting system, both contribute to the overall thermal efficiency of solar air heaters. Solar air heaters must be more efficient in order to be more affordable. This may be accomplished by increasing the heat transfer coefficient between the absorber plate and the air flow passing through the duct. More heat transfer coefficients can be increased by using either active or passive approaches. In most situations, it may be cost-effective to use solar air heaters and incorporate artificial roughness on the absorber plate. The rate of heat transmission from the solar air heater's duct to the fluid flow may be increased by creating artificial roughness on the surface of the duct. The study focused on several roughness element geometries for solar air heater ducts, and the results indicated that there is a link between the two.

Wasag,2012-04-26,"The removal of hydrogen sulphide is required for reasons of health, odour problems, safety and corrosivity problems. The means of removing hydrogen sulphide mainly depend on its concentration and kind of medium to be purified. The paper deals with a method of hydrogen sulphide removal from the air by its catalytic oxidation to elemental sulphur with the use of Fe-EDTA complex. The possibility of obtaining fibrous filtering materials able to remove small concentrations of H2S from the air were described. The base of these materials is fibrous ion exchanger with Fe(III)- EDTA complex immobilized on their functional groups. The complex of trivalent iron converts hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur. Bivalent iron formed in the reaction is oxidized by the atmospheric oxygen, so complex of trivalent iron is continuously regenerated and the overall process can be accounted as pseudocatalytic. In the present paper properties of several fibrous catalysts based on ion exchangers with different chemical nature (weak acid,weak base and strong base) were described. It was shown that the main parameters affecting the process of catalytic oxidation are:concentration of hydrogen sulphide in the air, relative humidity of the purified air, the process time and the content of Fe-EDTA complex in the fibres. The data presented show that the filtering layers with anion exchange package are much more active in the catalytic processes of hydrogen sulphide removal than cation exchanger and inert materials. In the addition to the nature of the fibres relative air humidity is a critical factor determining efficiency of the material in the air purification from H2S. It was proved that the most promising carrier of the Fe-EDTA catalyst for hydrogen sulphide oxidation are Fiban A-6 and Fiban AK-22 fibres.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/cee8d41e-e377-4017-bf6f-2b61b27e94ec/8495.pdf,pdf

The acidity index of fresh sunflower oil increased 13.7 times, with a value of 2.46 mg KOH·g-1 of fat for the thermo-oxidized oil compared to the initial value of 0.180 mg KOH·g-1 of fat. The thermo-oxidation of sunflower oil caused a significant decrease of the saponification index, which indicates a significant degree of polymerization and leads to viscosity increase of the studied sunflower oil. In order to highlight the impact of heat treatments, the analysis was performed by IR spectroscopy and the possible mechanisms of unsaturated fatty acids forced oxidation under the influence of thermal factor were analyzed. It was established that the applied treatment favoured both the formation of carbonyl secondary compounds and the simultaneous formation of hydroperoxides and triglycerides containing hydroxylated groups.

Previous efforts to forecast climate effects on brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) habitat have generally assumed uniform air–water temperature relationships over large areas that cannot account for groundwater inputs and other processes that operate at finer spatial scales. We developed regression models that accounted for groundwater influences on thermal sensitivity from measured air–water temperature relationships within forested watersheds in eastern North America (Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, USA, 78 sites in nine watersheds). We used these reach-scale models to forecast climate change effects on stream temperature and brook trout thermal habitat, and compared our results to previous forecasts based upon large-scale models. Observed stream temperatures were generally less sensitive to air temperature than previously assumed, and we attribute this to the moderating effect of shallow groundwater inputs. Predicted groundwater temperatures from air–water regression models corresponded well to observed groundwater temperatures elsewhere in the study area. Predictions of brook trout future habitat loss derived from our fine-grained models were far less pessimistic than those from prior models developed at coarser spatial resolutions. However, our models also revealed spatial variation in thermal sensitivity within and among catchments resulting in a patchy distribution of thermally suitable habitat. Habitat fragmentation due to thermal barriers therefore may have an increasingly important role for trout population viability in headwater streams.

These effects are likely to be strongest in ponds (standing water bodies primarily mixed by temperature changes than by wind), for whom precipitation makes up a large component of inflows. Although historical water temperature datasets are patchy for lentic systems, thermal mass effects are likely to outweigh impacts from ambient air temperatures in most locations and may show considerable independence from those trends.

69,Water availability influences thermal safety margins for leaves,10.5061/dryad.tht76hf04,"Cook, Alicia, Berry, Neil, Milner, Kirsty, Leigh, Andy",2021-06-27,"One application of plant physiological heat tolerance measurements is the assessment of vulnerability to increasing environmental temperatures under climatic change. A thermal safety margin, the difference between physiological tolerance and environmental temperature, is a common metric for the assessment of plant thermal vulnerability. However, there are biological and methodological aspects to consider when evaluating thermal vulnerability that have the potential to substantially alter assessments. Two such aspects include the leaf to air temperature relationship and the scale at which air temperature data are collected.
We grew plants of a desert species, Myoporum montanum, in situ under water- stressed and well-watered conditions, measured their leaf temperatures and photosynthetic heat tolerance (T50 threshold) every third day over 12 days in summer. Thermal safety margins were calculated based on leaf temperatures and compared to those calculated with local and regional air temperatures.
We found that heat tolerance and the thermal vulnerability assessment of a plant changed with water status. When water was readily available, plants maintained wide leaf temperature safety margins and displayed partial-homeothermy. When cooling via transpiration was limited, increasing leaf temperature corresponded with occurrences of leaf poikilo- and megathermy, higher heat tolerance, and narrower safety margins.
Our study shows high physiological heat thresholds are not necessarily reflective of wide safety margins, but instead can indicate a greater vulnerability and increased risk of heat stress exposure. Calculating thermal safety margins using air temperatures can also substantially alter margin widths. Where possible, the use of leaf temperatures in assessments of thermal vulnerability will lead to more meaningful vulnerability assessments. We recommend considering the source and temporal pairing of temperature measurements as well as plant water status, when measuring and interpreting plant thermal safety margins.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/d13a92b6-464c-449e-827a-e94b857144ad/FE_Cook_etal_AirLeafRegional_AveTemp_data.csv,csv

Among them, essential oils (EOs) used for aromatherapy had gained great interest regarding beauty, wellness and health. Constituted of wide and numerous ranges of volatile components, EOs are known to be susceptible to degradation reactions, such as oxidation. Changes in oil compositions may result in a loss of their properties or even in a new toxicity. Most of all, oxidated oils, as stronger allergens than native oils, are sources of great concern. Therefore, the present study aims to provide new data on the stability of Eos and blend of oils when exposed to air, a crucial parameter regarding EOs stability. Finally, the peroxide value analytical method was used as a parameter to followup the stability and oxidation rate of samples and, in the end, highlight potential protective effect of blends from oxidation. The results show that most of the blends in the present study were oxidation-proof, unlike the tested Eos contained which were sensitive to oxidation when they were not part of a blend (e.g., sweet orange, lemon and eucalyptus EOs).

The self-ignition behavior of hydrogen-propane mixed fuel is analyzed and compared with the heated feed case. Simulations indicate that hydrogen can successfully cause self-ignition of propane-air mixtures in catalytic micro-channels with a 0.2 mm gap size, eliminating the need for startup devices. The minimum hydrogen composition for propane self-ignition is found to be in the range of 0.8-2.8% (on a molar basis), and increases with increasing wall thermal conductivity, and decreasing inlet velocity or propane composition. Higher propane-air ratio results in earlier ignition. The ignition characteristics of hydrogen-assisted propane qualitatively resemble the selectively inlet feed preheating mode. Transient response of the mixed hydrogen- propane fuel reveals sequential ignition of propane followed by hydrogen. Front-end propane ignition is observed in all cases. Low wall thermal conductivities cause earlier ignition of the mixed hydrogen-propane fuel, subsequently resulting in low exit temperatures. The transient-state behavior of this micro-scale system is described, and the startup time and minimization of hydrogen usage are discussed.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/ff62ea93-1539-4222-807b-1f2c8d8b550e/10003920.pdf,pdf

This system could be alternatively used to decrease the temperature of intake air into the gas turbine and improve gas turbine efficiency. The present study investigated the presence of phase-change refrigeration storage. The complex system was modelled by a straightforward configuration of a rectangular cavity, which contained the phase change material with intermediate fluid. Reducing the temperature of the inlet air had a considerable impact on improving the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine cycles. In this study, a new cooling approach was proposed in which the intake air was cooled using a PCM-based heat exchanger along with an intake line. During the daylight hours, air moved over the phase change material, whose melting point was lower than the maximum temperature of the surrounding air. The melting process caused a decrease in surrounding air temperature before entering the compressor. Upon completion of the PCM melting, the necessary ambient air was taken from the surroundings utilizing conventional air inlet configurations. During the night-time, the ambient air was cooler, and the liquid PCM solidified. The temperature of the chosen PCM was lower than the maximum value of surrounding temperature. The numerical modelling of the PCM indicated that it was possible to reduce the temperature of the inlet air.

The residual porosity of the composites alters the thermo-physical properties of the material to a maximum level. During the impregnation of fibre in matrix (injection), the presence of air voids changes the direction of the flow of resin. This also affects the material properties in terms of flexibility, durability but agitates the effective thermal conductivity (keff).The physics behind the effect of air void on the effective thermal conductivity cannot be captured in commercial software or experiments. The best way to solve this problem is by numerical codes using finite element approach, by dividing the whole macroscopic domain into numerous subdomains as possible. The divided subdomain should be periodic in nature with respect to the whole domain. If the heterogeneities are similar, dual scale approach is used and so on. If the heterogeneities are different and if they are of two types, triple scale approach is used. The contrast ratio and volume percentage of fiber is used as variables. The air void creates a giant leap for saturation in both, which in turn effect the effective thermal conductivity. Air void troubles the effective thermal conductivity mainly because of its insignificance in scalar values of thermal conductivity when it is compared to fiber or matrix mathematically.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/f7c91dac-f13a-46f0-9626-f3ba06e34750/IJOER-MAR-2020-6.pdf,pdf

PVT can be utilized as a cooling system for the PV system to improve the electrical energy effectiveness and simultaneously, produce thermal power, which can be utilized in different applications. A combined photovoltaic - thermal system (PVT) is considered as an engaging creation in solar technology innovation. In these systems, the heat from the photovoltaic modules is extricated utilizing different strategies. The extracted heat is used in thermal systems independently. The unused radiations of the solar spectrum will dissipate their energy as heat in the solar cell. This heat dissipation causes thermal losses in the solar photovoltaic system, thereby reducing its performance. The yield of the PV cells lessens when the working temperature of the solar cell increments. Consequently, for better execution, it is fundamental to keep up the low working temperature of the solar cells. Photovoltaic–warm (PV-T) innovation comprises of an ordinary solar based PV board, combined with a solar thermal collector installed on the rear of the PV panel to pre-heat domestic hot water (DHW) or ventilation air. This permits a bigger segment of the solar energy occurrence on the authority to be transformed into helpful warm and electrical energy A primary feature of this system is that as the efficiency of a PV panel decreases as the cell temperature increases, it helps cool down the cell temperature by using air ventilation or water thus maintaining PV panel temperature. Water or air moving through the thermal collector eliminates heat from the PV cells, taking into account more proficient activity. In addition, water or air heating and electricity can be produced within the same footprint, resulting in more efficient use of valuable roof space.

transverse fins and wire mesh layers are constructed and investigated
experimentally for thermal efficiency at a geographic location of
Cyprus in the city of Famagusta. The absorber plate is replaced by
sixteen steel wire mesh layers, 0.18 x 0.18cm in cross section
opening and a 0.02cm in diameter. The wire mesh layers arranged in
three groups, first and second include 6 layers, while the third include
4 layers. All layers fixed in the duct parallel to the glazing and each
group separated from the others by wood frame thickness of 0.5cm to
reduce the pressure drop. The transverse fins arranged in a way to
force the air to flow through the bed like eight letter path with flow
depth 3cm. The proposed design has increased the heat transfer rate,
but on other hand causes a high pressure drop. The obtained results
show that, for air mass flow rate range between 0.011-0.036kg/s, the
thermal efficiency increases with increasing the air mass flow. The
maximum efficiency obtained is 65.6% for the mass flow rate of
0.036kg/s. Moreover, the temperature difference between the outlet
flow and the ambient temperature, ΔT, reduces as the air mass flow
rate increase. The maximum difference between the outlet and
ambient temperature obtained was 43°C for double pass for minimum
mass flow rate of 0.011kg/s. Comparison with a conventional solar
air heater collector shows a significantly development in the thermal
efficiency.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/1b85de9e-5799-4e2a-bb51-a31def1b8e00/8230.pdf,pdf
92,Using In-Situ Building Fabric Thermal Performance Testing to Calibrate As-Built Models of Low Energy Dwellings in the UK,10.5281/zenodo.4389985,"Rajat Gupta, Matt Gregg",2020-09-01,"This paper presents the methodology and results of in-situ building fabric thermal testing to calibrate as-built energy models of three low energy dwellings in the UK, so as to examine the gap between the as-designed and as-built energy performance. The in-situ tests included air permeability testing, along with thermal imaging and heat flux measurement. Despite the dwellings being designed to high thermal standards, heat flux measurements showed poor thermal quality of the walls and roof section even for the ‘good’ quality sections that were measured. Thermal imaging surveys revealed air leakage pathways around door/window openings, penetrations and junctions between walls and ceilings indicating poor detailing and workmanship. Air permeability (AP) was found to have increased after the initial test due to post-completion alteration to the building fabric. Though the results were higher than expected they were within the UK Building Regulations limiting fabric parameters. Calibration of the model through temperature monitoring provided less extreme projected energy performance gap than simply replacing the designed AP values and U-values with test results. Insights from the study have reinforced the need for national Building Regulations to require as-built energy models with in-situ test data to measure the gap between intent and outcomes.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/8d4019f7-1b74-477b-926d-bbf54120dcf4/In-situ%20building%20fabric%20thermal%20performance%20and%20calibration%20of%20as%20built%20models.pdf,pdf

The increase of impervious surfaces alongside with anthropogenic heat sources and the reduction of vegetated areas lead to elevated air and land surface temperatures and consequently to considerable public health risk. In this study a typology for thermal hot spots, that is areas in cities where higher than average land surface temperatures are consistently observed, is developed and applied – with the use of earth observation and ground data – for the city of Athens. Supervised classification is used to map the types of land cover in the study area, land surface temperatures are estimated using multi-seasonal satellite images (for specific synoptic conditions), and ground measurements of air temperature were used to establish a thorough understanding of the thermal environment. Results indicate that several hot spots exist (in some cases maximum surface temperatures exceeded 47°C in the summer months), especially in urban dense areas, the historic center of Athens and the industrial zone of the city. The recognition of thermal hot spots is important as they are practically urban hazards for health security, taken that they reflect areas where thermal comfort is reduced and photochemical air pollution is enhanced. Interventions in these areas are necessary for health security. ",https://zenodo.org/api/files/d27f7c35-2138-4f53-b5eb-fd389988260a/IJNHS-2572-7540-03-101.pdf,pdf

Usually, it en- counters instability in oxide growth and results in variation in the oxide thickness formed. This leads to downtime of furnace and wafer scrap. This study focuses on the factors leading to this phenomenon and finding the optimum settings of these factors. The factors that cause instability to oxide thickness were narrowed down to location of wafer in furnace, oxidation time, gas flow rate and temperature. Characterization and optimization were done using Design of Experiments. Full factorial design was implemented using 4 factors and 2 levels, resulting in 16 runs. Data analysis was done using Multiple Regression Analysis in JMP software. Actual versus predicted plot is examined to determine whether the model fit is significant. Adjusted R2 value was obtained at 99.8% or 0.998 indicating that there is very minimal variation of the data not explained by the model and thus confirming that the model is good. From the effect test, the factors were narrowed down from 4 factors to 3 factors. Location factor was found to have no impact. Significant factors that have impact are gas flow rate, oxidation time and temperature. Analyzing the leverage plots and least square mean plots, temperature was found to have the highest impact on oxide thickness. The model was further analyzed using prediction profiler in JMP to find the optimum settings for thermal oxidation process to meet the target oxide thickness of 8000A. Optimum setting for temperature was found to be at 958 C, gas flow rate at low flow rate (H2:6.5 slm and O2:4.5 slm), oxidation time at 280 min and location of wafers at both zone 1 and zone 2.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/001ae342-21a2-4393-83b8-32b4ff113121/02%2019857.pdf,pdf
