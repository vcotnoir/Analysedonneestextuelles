The catalysts have been characterized by different techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance (UV-vis DRS) and Raman spectroscopy. XRD results showed that Ce3+ ions were successfully incorporated into the ZnO lattice. UV-vis DRS spectra evidenced that Ce–ZnO samples present band-gap values of about 2.97 eV, lower than those of undoped ZnO (3.21 eV).

5,Adsorption of Pb(II) from aqueous solutions onto MgFeAl-CO3 LDH: thermodynamic and kinetic studies,10.5004/dwt.2020.24952,"AIT ICHOU Abdeljalil, BENHITI Ridouan, ABALI Mhamed, DABAGH Abdelkader, CHIBAN Mohamed, ZERBET Mohamed, CARJA Gabriela, SINAN Fouad",2020-02-01,"The objective of this work is to determine the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of adsorption of Pb(II) from aqueous solutions by synthetically prepared MgFeAl-CO3 as layered double hydroxide (LDH) adsorbent. Compared to other adsorbents for heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions, LDH materials possessed many advantages such as nontoxic synthesis, chemical stability, environmentally friendly, and facile separation from the water solution. The synthesis of LDH was achieved by a co-precipitation method. The reaction products were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy and N2 sorption–desorption isotherm analysis. The adsorption rates were investigated. The effect of the parameters such as contact time, initial metal ion concentration, and temperature on the adsorption of the Pb(II) was studied. Equilibrium was achieved in 60 min and the equilibrium adsorption capacity was found to be increased with the increase in the Pb(II) initial concentration. The removal efficiency of Pb(II) increases from 59.50% to 71.15% when the temperature increases from 15°C to 60°C. The pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and Elovich kinetic models were tested and the first was found to fit better to the experimental data. The application of the intra-particle diffusion model demonstrates that the surface diffusion and the intra-particle diffusion occur in parallel during the adsorption of Pb(II) onto MgFeAl-CO3. The equilibrium adsorption data were analyzed by Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson, and Temkin isotherm models. The results indicated that the Redlich–Peterson and Langmuir isotherms were the most suitable models for the obtained experimental data and the Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity of the MgFeAl-CO3 is found to be 117.86 mg g-1 at 298.15 K.

Salinas,2012-03-15,"In the face of increasing applications for nanotechnology, the potential for nanoparticles to bioaccumulate continues to be a major knowledge gap. The aim of this project was to evaluate bioconcentration and biomagnification of nano-cerium dioxide (CeO2, uncoated, mean particle size 28 nm) in fish via water and diet respectively. Carp (Cyprinus carpio) were exposed to treatments of nano-CeO2 (1 & 100 mg/L) and micro-CeO2 (100 mg/L, mean particle size 200 nm) dispersed in water containing 10 mg/L humic acid for 10 days. As a separate treatment, carp were fed nano-CeO2 at 68 mg/kg in diet for 10 days. Fish samples were collected on 3 occasions (at day 1, 4, 10), and water samples every third day. All samples were immediately analyzed for Ce by ICP-MS. The uptake of Ce was evaluated in selected tissues (liver, gastrointestinal tract, gills, skin and filet) and the carcass from dissected fish. The highest amounts of Ce were found in the gastrointestinal tract in both feeding and water exposures. In skin and gills considerably lower amounts of Ce were found.

19,IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIAL FEATURES IN THE ELECTROLYSIS­CAVITATION WATER TREATMENT IN POOLS,10.15587/1729-4061.2019.162229,"Liliya Shevchuk, Ivan Aftanaziv, Lesya Strutynska, Orysia Strogan, Igor Samsin",2019-04-30,"We developed an innovative technology of electrolysis-cavitation water purification and water treatment in pools. This method belongs to the group of physical water purification methods and its advantage is the absence of the need for costly chemical disinfectants and a degree of water purification from biological and organic pollutants of up to 97–98 %. A typical electrolytic water treatment process, based on electrolysis disengagement of sodium chloride with the formation of reactive sodium hypochlorite, is complemented by the operation of water cavitation disinfection from organic and biological pollutants. Prior to the electrolysis, the cavitation treatment of water in pools reduces by 75‒80 % the degree of its contamination, reduces approximately by two times the need in disinfectant produced by electrolysis installations. This proportionally reduces by 45–50 % the duration of energy-consuming electrolysis equipment operation and reduces by one-third the costs of electricity for water treatment operations.
For cavitation disinfection of water in pools, we have devised a new design of an industrial variant of the vibrocavitator with a resonance effect, studied the conditions for disturbing the cavitation processes within it, and developed a procedure for the design and calculation of its main components and parts. The block of vibrocavitators that precedes electrolysis water treatment ensures the oxidation of organic impurities in polluted water, including urea, to 75–77 %. The degree of biological water disinfection in this case reaches 80–82 % with a capacity of 3–3.5 m3/hour.
The power of electromagnets in a vibrocavitator drive is 1–1.5 kW, which is an order of magnitude less compared to the power of electrolysis installations. Given this, the proposed phased cavitation and electrolysis water treatment reduces the total energy consumption for a water treatment operation. For standard pools with a water volume of 3,000 m3 with electrolysis water treatment, the introduction of additional cavitation treatment will make it possible to reduce monthly energy consumption for a water treatment operation by about 1,200‒1,500 kW.

Ballast water has been a principal pathway of nonindigenous species introduction to global ports for much of the 20th century. In an effort to reduce the scale of this pathway, and recognizing forthcoming global regulations that will supplant ballast water exchange (BWE) with ballast water treatment (BWT), we explore whether a combined hybrid treatment of BWE and chlorination (Cl) exceeds individual effects of either BWE or chlorination alone in reducing densities of bacteria, microplankton and macroplankton. 2. Five full-scale trials were conducted on an operational bulk carrier travelling between Canada and Brazil. 3. The hybrid treatment generally had the lowest final densities among all treatments for putative enterococci, Escherichia coli, and coliform bacteria, as well as microplankton and macroplankton, with the former two being synergistically lower than individual treatments alone. Microplankton abundance in the hybrid treatment was significantly but antagonistically reduced relative to individual treatments alone. Macroplankton final density was lowest in the hybrid treatment, though the interaction between treatments was not significant. 4. Synthesis and applications. In most cases the combined hybrid treatment of ballast water exchange (BWE) and chlorination reduced population densities of indicator organisms in ballast water below those proposed by the International Maritime Organization's D-2 performance standards. BWE alone was often ineffective at reducing bacterial and macroplankton densities.

The oxidation of succinic acid by cerium(IV) has been studied spectrophotometrically in aqueous sulphuric acid medium at 298 K at constant ionic strength or 1.6 mol dm-3. A minute amount or ruthenium(lll) (10-6 mol dm-3) is sumcient to enhance the slow reaction between succinic acid and cerium(JV). The main reaction products are cerium(lll) and oxaloacetic acid. The stoichiometry is 1 : 4, that is[sue.acid] : [CeIV] == 1 : 4. The reaction is first order in both cerium(IV) and ruthnium(lll) concentrations. The order with respect to sue. acid concentration varies from first order to zero order, as the succinic acid concentration increases. Increase in sulphuric acid concentration decreases the reaction rate. The added sulphate and bisulpahte decreases the rate or reaction. The added product cerium(lll) retards the reaction rate. The active species or oxidant and catalyst are Ce(SO4)2 and [Ru(H2O)6]3+ respectively. Possible mechanism Is proposed.

A minute (10-8 mol dm-3) quantity of iodide mediated oxidation of arsenic(III) by cerium(IV) in an aqueous sulphuric acid and sulphate media has been studied spectrophotometrically at 25 °C. The stoichiometry is 1 : 2, i.e. one mole of arsenic(lll) requires two moles of cerium(IV). The reaction is first order each in cerium(IV) and iodide concentrations. The order with respect to arsenic(lll) is less than unity. Increase in sulphuric acid concentration increased the rate. In situ H+ ion concentration is calculated by the knowledge of equilibrium constants and the order with respect to H+ ion concentration is found to be less than unity. The ionic strength did not have any significant effect on the rate of reaction, whereas rate constant increased with decreasing dielectric constant of the medium. Added products cerium(lll) and arsenic(V) did not have any significant effect on the reaction rate. The active species of oxidant and reductant are Ce(SO4)2+ and Asl2+ respectively. A suitable mechanism is proposed. The catalytic constant and activation parameters are determined. The.results obtained in the present study are similar to that of bromide, chloride and iodide mediated oxidation of antimony(III) by cerium(IV) in aqueous sulphuric acid-sulfate media and are compared and discussed.

Using thin epitaxial films of ordered CeOx we investigate the influence of oxygen vacancy concentration and coordination on the oxidation of CeOx by water. Upon changing the CeOx stoichiometry from CeO2 to Ce2O3, we observe a transition from a slow surface reaction to a productive H2-evolving CeOx oxidation with reaction yields exceeding the surface capacity and indicating the participation of bulk OH species. Both the experiments and the ab-initio calculations associate the effective oxidation of highly-reduced CeOx by water to the network of next-nearest-neighbor oxygen vacancies present in the bixbyite c-Ce2O3 phase. Next- nearest-neighbor oxygen vacancies allow for the effective incorporation of water in the bulk via formation of OH- groups. Bulk hydroxylation is proved to be absent in other CeOx phases, where the average distance between oxygen vacancies is larger than in the c-Ce2O3. Our study illustrates that the coordination of oxygen vacancies in CeOx represents an important parameter to be considered in understanding and improving the reactivity of ceria-based catalysts.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/3d8ca45e-c976-4c9c-8ee0-d495b54c62b9/paper_ACS_catalysis.pdf,pdf,"reaction of reduced cerium oxide CeOx with water be fundamental process omnipresent in ceria - base catalysis . use thin epitaxial film of order CeOx we investigate the influence of oxygen vacancy concentration and coordination on the oxidation of CeOx by water . upon change the CeOx stoichiometry from ceo2 to ce2o3 , we observe a transition from a slow surface reaction to a productive h2 - evolve CeOx oxidation with reaction yield exceed the surface capacity and indicate the participation of bulk OH specie . both the experiment and the ab - initio calculation associate the effective oxidation of highly - reduce CeOx by water to the network of next - nearest - neighbor oxygen vacancy present in the bixbyite c - ce2o3 phase .

bed of gravel provides ideal conditions for the formation of compact
settleable flocs because of continuous recontact provided by the

A bibliometric analysis based on the Web of Science database was employed to analyze the global scientific outputs of magnetic graphene for water treatment until the present time (2012 to 2017), to improve the understanding of the research trends. The publication year, place of publication, institutes, funding agencies, journals, most cited articles, distribution outputs in thematic categories and applications were analyzed. Three major aspects analyzed including type of pollutant, treatment process and composite composition have further contributed to revealing the research trends.

The reaction between cerium(IV) and N-(2-hydroxyethyl)phthalimide (NHEP) is very slow in sulphuric acid medium at 25 ºC. However, the reaction is facile in presence of ethylenediamminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in aqueous sulphuric acid medium. The reaction between cerium(IV) and NHEP in presence of EDTA exhibits 1 : 1 (oxidant : reductant) stoichiometry. The products are identified as cerium(III)-EDTA complex, n-methylphthalimide and formaldehyde. The order with respect to oxidant concentration is unity, whereas the order with respect to both substrate and catalyst concentration is less than unity. Increase in sulphuric acid concentration increases the rate of reaction. The order with respect to H+ ion concentration is less than unity. The added product cerium(III), did not have any significant effect on the rate of reaction in presence of EDTA. The active species of oxidant is identified as CeSO42+. Based on the experimental results a suitable mechanism is proposed. The activation parameters and thermodynamic quantities are also determined and discussed.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/5c544f15-4735-4a4f-808c-37671e9154cd/141-150.pdf,pdf,"P.G.

International Water management Institute IWMI predicts that by 2025, one in three Indians will live in a condition of absolute water scarcity. Water from the industries, households, etc. has been discharged into the streams without being treated first. Thus, clean water has become a luxury in many water scarce areas. Due to the consumption of contaminated water, people are falling prey to water borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, etc. The widely used approach to counter such problem has been the use of water treatment plants in cities and towns and water filters in households. However, in a developing country like India water treatment plants and filters in small villages are a rare sight. The major reason for this is the funds required. Also, the processes that are in existence for water treatment are primarily chemical based. With the discovery of processes like phytoremediation, it has become possible to incorporate biological processes in water treatment Piyush Gupta et al. 2012 . Moreover the voids between broken bricks, etc. can be used to trap sediments. Natural coagulants such as moringa oleifera can be used to remove colloidal impurities Abirami. M and Rohini C 2017 . Thus, this assembly of scrap or natural material is not only cheap and easily available but it is also efficient in removing the impurities and improving the BOD, COD and DO levels Nayanthara and Bindu 2017 .

Any physical, chemical or biological condition that prevents the designated uses of a water body represents poor water quality. Effluent water is always associated with environmental and human health problems. Many wastewater treatment plants were designed to remove nutrients and pathogens. However, there are many factors that lead to their failure to perform effectively. A study was carried out at Hatcliffe Sewage Treatment Works (HSTW), a major supplier of water to upper parts of Chinyika River in Zimbabwe. The effluent pollution level was analyzed. Chemical water quality parameters were analyzed according to the standard methods for analysis of water and wastewater and biological water quality was based on results obtained by Matenga (2004). It was found that HSTW affects the quality of water in upper Chinyika River chemically and biologically. It was also inferred that upgrading the wastewater treatment plant cannot alone achieve improved water quality. However, integrating sediment dredging, enhancing public participation, institutional cooperation and internalizing of environmental externalities could improve water quality of upper Chinyika River.

In addition, climate change will exacerbate availability of water in sufficient quantity and quality. Since its implementation, conventional wastewater treatment has increasingly contributed to environmental protection and health of humans. However, with the increasing pollution of water by chemicals, conventional treatment turned out to be insufficient. It was also found that advanced effluent treatment methods such as extended filtration, the sorption to activated charcoal or advanced oxidation methods have their own limitations. These are, for example, increased demand for energy and hazardous chemicals, incomplete or even no removal of pollutants, the generation of unwanted products from parent compounds (transformation products, TPs) of often-unknown chemical structure, fate and toxicity. In many countries, effluent treatment is available only rarely if at all let alone advanced treatment. The past should teach us, that focusing only on technological approaches is not constructive for a sustainable water quality control. Therefore, in addition to conventional and advanced treatment optimization more emphasis on input prevention is urgently needed, including more and better control of what is present in the source water. Measures for input prevention are known for long. The main focus though has always been on the treatment, and measures taken at the source have gained only little attention so far. A more effective and efficient approach, however, would be to avoid pollution at the source, which would in turn allow more targeted treatment to meet treated water quality objectives globally. New developments within green and sustainable chemistry are offering new approaches that allow for input prevention and a more targeted treatment to succeed in pollution elimination in and at the source. To put this into practice, engineers, water scientists and chemists as well as microbiologists and scientists of other related disciplines need to cooperate more extensively than in the past. Applying principles such as the precautionary principle, or keeping water flows separate where possible will add to this. This implies not minimizing the efforts to improve wastewater treatment but to design effluents and chemicals in such a way that treatment systems and water environments can cope successfully with the challenge of micropollutants globally (Kümmerer et al., 2018). This paper therefore presents in its first part some of the limitations of effluent treatment in order to demonstrate the urgent need for minimizing water pollution at the source and, information on why source management is urgently needed to improve water quality and stimulate discussions how to protect water resources on a global level. Some principles of green and sustainable chemistry as well as other approaches, which are part of source management, are presented in the second part in order to stimulate discussion.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/f3d14318-faf4-4898-a7c3-1ce440bb0cb0/1-s2.0-S0048969718341123-main.pdf,pdf,"pharmaceutical and many other chemical be an important basis for nearly all sector include for example , food and agriculture , medicine , plastic , electronic , transport , communication , and many other product use nowadays . this come along with a tremendous chemicalization of the globe , include ubiquitous presence of product of chemical and pharmaceutical industry in the aquatic environment . use of these product will increase with population growth and living standard as will the need for clean water . in addition , climate change will exacerbate availability of water in sufficient quantity and quality . since its implementation , conventional wastewater treatment have increasingly contribute to environmental protection and health of human . however , with the increase pollution of water by chemical , conventional treatment turn out to be insufficient . it be also find that advanced effluent treatment method such as extended filtration , the sorption to activate charcoal or advanced oxidation method have their own limitation . these be , for example , increase demand for energy and hazardous chemical , incomplete or even no removal of pollutant , the generation of unwanted product from parent compound ( transformation product , tps ) of often - unknown chemical structure , fate and toxicity . in many country , effluent treatment be available only rarely if at all let alone advanced treatment . the past should teach we , that focus only on technological approach be not constructive for a sustainable water quality control . therefore , in addition to conventional and advanced treatment optimization more emphasis on input prevention be urgently need , include more and well control of what be present in the source   water . measure for input prevention be know for long . the main focus though have always be on the treatment , and measure take at the source have gain only little attention so far . a more effective and efficient approach , however , would be to avoid pollution at the source , which would in turn allow more targeted treatment to meet treat water quality objective globally . new development within green and sustainable chemistry be offer new approach that allow for input prevention and a more targeted treatment to succeed in pollution elimination in and at the source . to put this into practice , engineer , water scientist and chemist as well as microbiologist and scientist of other relate discipline need to cooperate more extensively than in the past . apply principle such as the precautionary principle , or keep water flow separate where possible will add to this . this imply not minimize the effort to improve wastewater treatment but to design effluent and chemical in such a way that treatment system and water environment can cope successfully with the challenge of micropollutant globally ( Kümmerer et al . , 2018 ) . this paper therefore present in its first part some of the limitation of effluent treatment in order to demonstrate the urgent need for minimize water pollution at the source and , information on why source management be urgently need to improve water quality and stimulate discussion how to protect water resource on a global level . some principle of green and sustainable chemistry as well as other approach , which be part of source management , be present in the second part in order to stimulate discussion ."

95,Failing Flows: Water Management in Southern Iraq,10.5281/zenodo.7215137,"Azhar Al Rubaie, Michael Mason, Zainab Mehdi",2022-07-15,"In July 2018 massive protests erupted in Basra city as residents demanded improvements in public services. Failings in water management were at the heart of local grievances: an outbreak of water-related illnesses was triggered by the use of polluted water from the Shatt al-Arab, Basra’s main source of water. Given the devastating outcomes of the outbreak, Basra started to heavily depend on the Bada’a Canal, the main source of freshwater for Basra. However, the deterioration of public water infrastructure has its roots in decades of armed conflict and international sanctions. Tap water has been undrinkable since the 1990s, forcing households to rely on private water vendors. Water infrastructure upgrading was a priority for state-rebuilding after 2003 but receded under the sectarian civil war. Governmental and donor plans for mega-infrastructure water projects have since stalled in the face of systemic corruption and racketeering. Compact water treatment units (CWTUs) remain the dominant purification technology, supplying 83% of treatment capacity across Basra governorate and 92% in Basra city. The efficiency of CWTUs supplying Basra city is restricted by irregular flows from the Bada’a Canal to the key conduit of the R-Zero water treatment plant. These flows are impacted by upstream dam construction, climatic variability and illegal water tapping. The operational capacity of CWTUs is also limited by under-investment in their maintenance, often reducing their working life to 10-15 years. There is a pressing policy need to diversify water sources for Basra and improve the efficiencies of treatment technologies and distribution networks. Regional efforts should focus on fair and equitable water sharing between Iraq and its riparian neighbours.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/38c992fe-accc-462d-aa1d-1ca031249cb6/Failing%20Flows%20%282021%29.pdf,pdf,"in July 2018 massive protest erupt in Basra city as resident demand improvement in public service . failing in water management be at the heart of local grievance : an outbreak of water - relate illness be trigger by the use of polluted water from the Shatt al - Arab , Basra ’s main source of water . give the devastating outcome of the outbreak , Basra start to heavily depend on the Bada’a Canal , the main source of freshwater for Basra . however , the deterioration of public water infrastructure have its root in decade of armed conflict and international sanction . tap water have be undrinkable since the 1990s , force household to rely on private water vendor . water infrastructure upgrading be a priority for state - rebuilding after 2003 but recede under the sectarian civil war . governmental and donor plan for mega - infrastructure water project have since stall in the face of systemic corruption and racketeering . compact water treatment unit ( cwtu ) remain the dominant purification technology , supply 83 % of treatment capacity across Basra governorate and 92 % in Basra city . the efficiency of cwtu supply Basra city be restrict by irregular flow from the Bada’a Canal to the key conduit of the R - zero water treatment plant . these flow be impact by upstream dam construction , climatic variability and illegal water tapping . the operational capacity of cwtu be also limit by under - investment in their maintenance , often reduce their work life to 10 - 15 year . there be a press policy need to diversify water source for Basra and improve the efficiency of treatment technology and distribution network . regional effort should focus on fair and equitable water sharing between Iraq and its riparian neighbour ."

Due to industrialization a number of different industries have become interested to invest in our country. Some of the industries are discharging their waste water without treatment to the water bodies causing ecological imbalance in aquatic life as a whole. In this study water samples were collected from two industries, manufacturing leather chemicals and kraft paper. A laboratory scale treatability study was conducted to find out an appropriate treatment procedure to achieve a depletion of pollutants - BOD and COD to a level to meet the standard for discharge to surface water bodies. The treatment procedure was standardized and a physicochemical treatment followed by biological treatment and tertiary treatment was found to be more suitable. The dosing rate of chemicals and retention period of biological degradation were fixed. On the basis of the findings the design criteria of individual units of effluent treatment plant was finalized.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/91750417-47eb-4fca-9c97-ae038aec5049/485-496.pdf,pdf,"Department of Chemistry and Environment , Heritage Institute of Technology , Anand pur ,

Human NIS expression is primarily recorded as a cytoplasmic protein, thus limiting its scope for targeted radio-iodine therapy. While developing NIS transgene over-expressing MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma, a few unique clonal derivatives show predominant expression in plasma membrane, whereas majority others show cytosolic expression over long passages. The membrane lineage shows un-perturbed dynamic trafficking of NIS through secretory pathway organelles, when compared to cytoplasmic or parental cells. Further, treatment of membrane cells with specific glycosylation inhibitors highlights the importance of inherent glycosylation processing. The 84 gene signature glycosylation RT-Profiler array reveals that membrane clones cluster separately from the rest.
