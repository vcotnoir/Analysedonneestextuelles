Ordinary and nanostructured samples of aluminum, copper, bronze C95200, an aluminum-magnesium alloy 518.0, and an aluminum-matrix dispersion-reinforced composite containing 6.3 wt% titanium were studied. Structuring processing of metallic materials was carried out in the liquid phase state. The aluminum-matrix composite was synthesized by powder metallurgy. A model electrolyte solution, containing 30 g / L NaCl and an addition of acetic acid to pH = 4.0, was used as a corrosive medium. Corrosion resistance test base was 144 hours, temperature + 22 ° C, the volume of the solution in the cell with three samples was 500 ml. The relative calculated test error was 5%.

The electrical conductivity of aluminum is 65.45% of that of copper. The tensile strength of aluminum wire is 150–170 MPa which, at equal conductivity, is about 65% of the strength of copper wire. This strength of aluminum wire is sufficient for bearing the wire's own weight but may be too low in case of snow, ice or wind overloads. One way to improve the strength of aluminum wire is to use aluminum alloys having higher strength combined with sufficiently high electrical conductivity, e.g. the E-AlMgSi alloy (Aldrey). The key strengthening agent of the E-AlMgSi alloy (Aldrey) is the Mg2Si phase which imparts high mechanical strength to aluminum. In this work we present experimental data on the kinetics of high-temperature oxidation and electrochemical corrosion of indium doped E-AlMgSi aluminum conductor alloy (Aldrey). Thermal gravimetric study has shown that indium doping and high temperature exposure increase the oxidation rate of E-AlMgSi alloy (Aldrey), with the apparent alloy oxidation activation energy decreasing from 120.5 to 91.8 kJ/mole.

Gravimetric analysis confirmed that the highest corrosion rate is shown at pH 13 followed by pH 1. Minimum corrosion occurs in the pH range of 3.0 to 11 due to establishment of passive layer on the surface. The highest corrosion rate at pH 13 is due to the presence of sodium hydroxide in the solution which dissolves the surface oxide film at a steady rate. At pH 1, it can be attributed that the presence of aggressive chloride ions serves to pick up the damage of the passive films at localized regions. With varying exposure periods by both, the environment complies with the normal corrosion rate profile that is an initial steep rise followed by a nearly constant value of corrosion rate. Resistivity increases in case of pH 1 solution for the higher pit formation and decreases at pH 13 due to formation of thin film.

The present study evaluates the impact of environmental exposure and accelerated aging of the reflector material. The study is conducted to assess the reflector material's durability to withstand environmental exposure and accelerated aging test. The evaluation is conducted using four different reflector materials commonly used in concentrated solar power: stainless steel and silvered-glass mirror (solid-state reflector), aluminum and silvered-polymer film (sheet-based reflector). The environmental exposure and accelerated aging test are conducted for 1,080 hours according to the standard reference of ISO 8565:2011 and ASTM B117–11. The mass loss after exposure is used as a reference to determine the corrosion rate for each reflector. Further observation is conducted by using microscope light to observe the effect of exposure on the surface of the reflector. Each reflector indicates a different corrosion rate which implies different weather resistance for each reflector type. The highest corrosion rate is found on aluminum film, with a value of 295.8 g/m2.year. The accelerated aging test through neutral salt spray demonstrates that a metallic reflector has a higher corrosion rate compared to a silvered-glass mirror which uses silicon dioxide as the top coating. Microscope observation demonstrates that suitable protection from soiling elements for the silvered-glass mirror is mainly caused by the presence of silicon dioxide on the top surface of this reflector.

Aluminum is ideally suited to anodizing, although other nonferrous metals, such as magnesium and titanium, also can be anodized. The anodic oxide structure originates from the aluminum substrate and is composed entirely of aluminum oxide. This aluminum oxide is not applied to the surface like paint or plating, but is fully integrated with the underlying aluminum substrate, so cannot chip or peel. It has a highly ordered, porous structure that allows for secondary processes such as coloring and sealing. In this experimental paper, we focus on a reliable method for fabricating nanoporous alumina with high regularity. Starting from study of nanostructure materials synthesize methods. After that, porous alumina fabricate in the laboratory by anodization of aluminum oxide. Hard anodization processes are employed to fabricate the nanoporous alumina using 0.3M oxalic acid and 90, 120 and 140 anodized voltages. The nanoporous templates were characterized by SEM and FFT. The nanoporous templates using 140 voltages have high ordered. The pore formation, influence of the experimental conditions on the pore formation, the structural characteristics of the pore and the oxide chemical reactions involved in the pore growth are discuss.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/359f102d-a9d0-41b2-83ff-b8ee09be4855/11121.pdf,pdf,"anodizing be an electrochemical process that convert the metal surface into a decorative , durable , corrosion - resistant , anodic oxide finish .

30,Heat capacity and thermodynamic functions of E-AlMgSi (Aldrey) aluminum conductor alloy doped with gallium,10.3897/j.moem.6.1.55277,"Ganiev, Izatullo N., Aliev, Firdavs A., Odinazoda, Haydar O., Safarov, Ahror M., Jayloev, Jamshed H.",2020-03-30,"Aluminum is a metal having permanently broadening applications. Currently aluminum and its alloys successfully replace conventional metals and alloys in a number of application fields. The wide use of aluminum and its alloys is primarily stipulated by its advantageous properties e.g. low density, high corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity as well as the possibility of applying protective and decorative coatings. In combination with great abundance and relatively low cost which has been almost constant in recent years, this permanently broadens the application range of aluminum. The electrochemical industry is one of the promising application fields of aluminum. The E-AlMgSi type (Aldrey) conductor aluminum alloy has high strength and ductility. This alloy acquires high electrical conductivity upon appropriate heat treatment. Products made from it are used almost exclusively for overhead power lines. This work presents data on the temperature dependence of heat capacity, heat conductivity and thermodynamic functions of the E-AlMgSi (Aldrey) aluminum alloy doped with gallium. The studies have been carried out in ""cooling"" mode. It has been shown that with an increase in temperature the heat capacity and thermodynamic functions of E-AlMgSi (Aldrey) alloy doped with gallium increase while the Gibbs energy decreases. Gallium doping to 1 wt.% reduces the heat capacity, enthalpy and entropy of the initial alloy and increases the Gibbs energy.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/69b32323-e980-45cb-a496-b7d7641e2cca/MoEM_article_55277.pdf,pdf,"Aluminum be a metal have permanently broaden application . currently aluminum and its alloy successfully replace conventional metal and alloy in a number of application field . the wide use of aluminum and its alloy be primarily stipulate by its advantageous property e.g. low density , high corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity as well as the possibility of apply protective and decorative coating . in combination with great abundance and relatively low cost which have be almost constant in recent year , this permanently broaden the application range of aluminum . the electrochemical industry be one of the promising application field of aluminum . the E - almgsi type ( Aldrey ) conductor aluminum alloy have high strength and ductility . this alloy acquire high electrical conductivity upon appropriate heat treatment . product make from it be use almost exclusively for overhead power line . this work present datum on the temperature dependence of heat capacity , heat conductivity and thermodynamic function of the e - almgsi ( Aldrey ) aluminum alloy dope with gallium . the study have be carry out in "" cool "" mode . it have be show that with an increase in temperature the heat capacity and thermodynamic function of E - almgsi ( Aldrey ) alloy dope with gallium increase while the Gibbs energy decrease . gallium dope to 1 wt.% reduce the heat capacity , enthalpy and entropy of the initial alloy and increase the Gibbs energy ."

[1-3].Electro-less or autocatalytic plating involves the chemical reducing agent to convert metallic ions into metallic state in the solution. In electro-less plating, substrate acts as cathode andthe salt is used as anode. Electric current is passed through salt instead of electrodes and reducing agent provides electrons. Surface cleaning and activation is necessary for deposition and different metals have different methods of cleaning and activation[4].Electro-less nickel-phosphorus alloy coatings are of great interest now a day due to their successful properties such as high hardness, good corrosion resistance, uniform thickness and good magnetic response. These coatings are considered as functional coatings due to their applications in different industries such automotive, aerospace, chemical, oil and gas[5].

Electro-less Ni-W-P coating on aluminum substrate is useful coating to avoid pitting corrosion and to increase hardness. It has many applications in different industries such as different types of control valves, engine valves, aluminum blow molds, aluminum pelletizers, bearings, rollers, gears, hydraulics, aluminum fuel filters, components in contact with alcohol, aluminum connecters, spacers and assemblies etc. In electro-less Ni-W-P coating, sodium hypophosphite is used as reducing agent to reduce nickel metal ions. Chemical reduction takes place in this method[6].Aluminum substrates make a strong oxide layer on its surface which is destroyed in corrosive environment so electro-less Ni-W-P coating is applied to protect aluminum from pitting corrosion. Due to oxide layer, there is poor adhesion between substrate and the required coating. Zincacting is the process which enhances the adhesion. In this process thin layer of zinc is applied after activation of the substrate. Thin layer of copper plating may also be done for reinforcement of the coating. In electro-less plating, firstly nucleation sites (activation sites) are formed which are main center to start and to continue the coating. When work piece is immersed into the solution, islands start to form around the nucleation sites and then these sites increases in size and merge in each other with passage of time. Thus, a dense and uniform coating is formed and this phenomenon is time dependent. Nucleation sites also changes the direction of the crystals deposited on the substrate with the help of ions supplied from the solution.

The purpose of the present study is to obtain an effective coating with increased corrosion resistance in corrosive environment. Electro-less Ni-W-P coating is directly carried out on pure aluminum and effect of bath temperature on crystal structure, deposition rate; surface morphology, chemical composition and corrosion resistance of Ni-W-P plated aluminum are observed.
Aluminum (Al) substrates of 99.5% purity, 1×2cm2, were cut in form of strips. Ni-W-P deposit was obtained from different chemicals such as sodium tungstate, sodium hypophosphite, and nickel sulfate are the materials used for experimental work.
Pickling and degreasing is followed in this work because it is effective for the adhesion of coatings.Oxide layer was removed from the sample by washing with detergent followed by pickled in a solution of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid (HNO3+HF, 3:1) for 2min. The washed and surface clean samples was then used for coating.To remove oxide layer, firstly zinc coating was done on aluminum substrate for 10sec at 30˚C. For reinforcement of Ni-W-P coating, copper electroplating was through above zinc coating at 4.5A of current upon 60˚C. The change in the physiochemical properties of aluminum, Ni-W-P alloy coating is then employed above copper electroplating. Chemical composition of Ni-W-P coating is given below in table 1.

The hardness of as received and coated samples were determined by Micro-Vickers hardness machine having 490.3mN load. Potentiostat was used for corrosion test and cyclic polarization test was performed to analyze pitting corrosion as aluminum suffers from pitting corrosion. For that analysis, electrolyte was made in 1000ml distilled water containing 0.9% NaCl with HCl giving 4-5 PH. Electrolyte in another beaker was made with graphite electrode and standard electrode. Then samples were tested to get corrosion curves. The micrographs of coated specimens were carried out on scanning electron microscope (SEM) (S-3000N) at different magnifications such as 250X, 370X, 500X, 1000X, 3000X, 7000X and 10000X to identified different modes of surfaces.
The SEM results of electro-less nickel alloy coating with secondary zinc and copper treatment shows that the surface topography of the deposit contains spherical nodular structure with very fine and compact grains. The surface morphology of the coating is shown in figure 1. These results clearly indicates that nodular size decreases with increase in tungsten content which indicates that deposit is adherent. Electro-less Ni-P-W deposition is a time dependent nucleation and growth phenomena for an adherent coating. Firstly, after nucleation, the Ni-P alloy grains grow into spherical nodules. Secondly, the number of nucleating sites increases with time, creating more nodules. With increase in plating time, deposition on surface occurs and then these new deposited Ni-P alloy particles become new nucleation center to deposit further particles. So, deposition rate of phosphorus and tungsten particles increases until surface is completely covered with coating. The as-formed coating has the catalytic activity required for the autocatalytic reaction, and this promoted the nucleation and growth of the coating in the transverse direction. Fig.1shows micrographs of Ni-W-P coating with 7, 9 and 11g/l Na2WO4 compositions at magnification of 7000X.

Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) was done to detect energy spectrum as shown in figure 2. It is investigated that the surface of the sample contains elements of Ni, W, P, Cu and Zn because the sample is subjected to zinc and copper treatment before electro-less Ni-W-P plating.  The contents of the coating increase with increase in time but content of zinc and copper disappear gradually after some time because nickel, tungsten, phosphorus particles are mainly deposited on zinc and copper coating. Figure 2illustrate the composition spectrums of different concentrations of Na2WO4 such as 7, 9 and 11%.

The cyclic polarization curve of bare aluminum and coated samples with different concentration of tungsten was observed as shown in Figure 3. Cyclic Polarization test tells about probability of pitting corrosion, breakdown potential (Pitting Potential) and protection potential. According to the graph given below, in pure aluminum no loop is made which means that there is severe pitting corrosion. As tungsten content is increased, a hysteresis loop is made but loop is not closed which means that there is some pitting corrosion. The area of loop tells about the probability of pitting corrosion. As further tungsten content is increased, revers scan becomes close to forward scan showing less pitting corrosion and when more tungsten content is increased then loop becomes close which indicate protection potential which means that coating is protected.
In curves in figure 3 suggests that samples are firstly catholically polarized where hydrogen evolution occurs and then anodically polarized where metal dissolution occurs. This scan is called forward scan. After that a potential is given to take metal ions from solution which is called reverse scan. When forward scan cut the revers scan then protection potential is reported. After 60 minutes, coating becomes saturated with improved coverage and thickness.

Corrosion potential and corrosion current shows in increasing trend by adding intermediate copper and zinc layers corrosion potential is increased which indicates better adherence between coating and substrate. Copper layer is introduced because it has lower difference of coefficient of thermal expansion with Ni-W-P coating and it also makes good adhesion with zinc. Hence, corrosion resistance is increased by introducing copper layer.
The hardness of Ni-W-P coating increases with increase in concentration of tungsten content and time as shown in Figure.4given below. Due to increase in the concentration of tungsten the spherical size decrease and particle become smaller due to which hardness increases.

4.Conclusions
After the electro less plating for a fix time, the Ni-W-P particles deposited on the surface of the sample were seen to increase with the plating time.  The particles begin to accumulate, grow, fuse, and have a nodular structure on the surface. During the initial stage of electro-less nickel plating, nickel-phosphorus particles were deposited near the Cu particles and between the Cu particles. Zincating process was used for activation of surface and to get fine nodules of the coating. Zinc and copper layers were plated before Ni-W-P coating for better adhesion.
Hardness was increased with the increase in tungsten content and plating time which can be used to replace some metals and save resources. With increase in plating time, thickness of the coating was increased and porosity was decreased. Atomic binding force against plastic deformation was increased by co-deposition of tungsten so that the hardness of the deposits of Ni–W–P was higher than the Ni–P deposits and substrate. Thus, the properties of electro-less Ni–P coatings were enhanced by co-deposition with tungsten. Electro-less Ni–P–W plating exhibited a nodular surface profile. Corrosion studies indicated that as composition of sodium tungstate increases, coating becomes nobler. As a result, the bonding of Ni–W–P deposit and aluminium substrate is in good condition.

[ 1 - 3].electro - less or autocatalytic plating involve the chemical reduce agent to convert metallic ion into metallic state in the solution . in electro - less plate , substrate act as cathode andthe salt be use as anode . electric current be pass through salt instead of electrode and reduce agent provide electron . surface cleaning and activation be necessary for deposition and different metal have different method of clean and activation[4].electro - less nickel - phosphorus alloy coating be of great interest now a day due to their successful property such as high hardness , good corrosion resistance , uniform thickness and good magnetic response . these coating be consider as functional coating due to their application in different industry such automotive , aerospace , chemical , oil and gas[5 ] . 

 electro - less ni - w - p coating on aluminum substrate be useful coating to avoid pit corrosion and to increase hardness . it have many application in different industry such as different type of control valve , engine valve , aluminum blow mold , aluminum pelletizer , bearing , roller , gear , hydraulic , aluminum fuel filter , component in contact with alcohol , aluminum connecter , spacer and assembly etc . in electro - less ni - w - p coating , sodium hypophosphite be use as reduce agent to reduce nickel metal ion . chemical reduction take place in this method[6].Aluminum substrate make a strong oxide layer on its surface which be destroy in corrosive environment so electro - less ni - w - p coating be apply to protect aluminum from pit corrosion . due to oxide layer , there be poor adhesion between substrate and the required coating . zincacting be the process which enhance the adhesion . in this process thin layer of zinc be apply after activation of the substrate . thin layer of copper plating may also be do for reinforcement of the coating . in electro - less plating , firstly nucleation site ( activation site ) be form which be main center to start and to continue the coating . when work piece be immerse into the solution , island start to form around the nucleation site and then these site increase in size and merge in each other with passage of time . thus , a dense and uniform coating be form and this phenomenon be time dependent . nucleation site also change the direction of the crystal deposit on the substrate with the help of ion supply from the

 the hardness of as receive and coated sample be determine by Micro - Vickers hardness machine have 490.3mn load . Potentiostat be use for corrosion test and cyclic polarization test be perform to analyze pit corrosion as aluminum suffer from pit corrosion . for that analysis , electrolyte be make in 1000ml distil water contain 0.9 % NaCl with HCl give 4 - 5 ph . Electrolyte in another beaker be make with graphite electrode and standard electrode . then sample be test to get corrosion curve . the micrograph of coated specimen be carry out on scan electron microscope ( SEM ) ( S-3000N ) at different magnification such as 250X , 370X , 500X , 1000X , 3000X , 7000X and 10000X to identify different mode of surface . 
 the SEM result of electro - less nickel alloy coating with secondary zinc and copper treatment show that the surface topography of the deposit contain spherical nodular structure with very fine and compact grain . the surface morphology of the coating be show in figure 1 . these result clearly indicate that nodular size decrease with increase in tungsten content which indicate that deposit be adherent . Electro - less ni - p - w deposition be a time dependent nucleation and growth phenomena for an adherent coating . firstly , after nucleation , the Ni - p alloy grain grow into spherical nodule . secondly , the number of nucleating site increase with time , create more nodule . with increase in plate time , deposition on surface occur and then these new deposit Ni - p alloy particle become new nucleation center to deposit further particle . so , deposition rate of phosphorus and tungsten particle increase until surface be completely cover with coating . the as - form coating have the catalytic activity require for the autocatalytic reaction , and this promote the nucleation and growth of the coating in the transverse direction . fig.1show micrograph of Ni - w - p coating with 7 , 9 and 11g / l Na2WO4 composition at magnification of 7000x.

 Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy ( EDS ) be do to detect energy spectrum as show in figure 2 . it be investigate that the surface of the sample contain element of Ni , W , p , Cu and Zn because the sample be subject to zinc and copper treatment before electro - less ni - w - p plate .    the content of the coating increase with increase in time but content of zinc and copper disappear gradually after some time because nickel , tungsten , phosphorus particle be mainly deposit on zinc and copper coating . figure 2illustrate the composition spectrum of different concentration of Na2WO4 such as 7 , 9 and 11 % . 
 fig.2composition spectrum of concentration of Wwith 7 % , 9 % and 11 % 
 the cyclic polarization curve of bare aluminum and coated sample with different concentration of tungsten be observe as show in Figure 3 . Cyclic Polarization test tell about probability of pit corrosion , breakdown potential ( Pitting Potential ) and protection potential . accord to the graph give below , in pure aluminum no loop be make which mean that there be severe pitting corrosion . as tungsten content be increase , a hysteresis loop be make but loop be not close which mean that there be some pitting corrosion . the area of loop tell about the probability of pit corrosion . as far tungsten content be increase , rever scan become close to forward scan show less pit corrosion and when more tungsten content be increase then loop become close which indicate protection potential which mean that coating be protect . 
 in curve in figure 3 suggest that sample be firstly catholically polarize where hydrogen evolution occur and then anodically polarize where metal dissolution occur . this scan be call forward scan . after that a potential be give to take metal ion from solution which be call reverse scan . when forward scan cut the rever scan then protection potential be report . after 60 minute , coating becomes saturate with improved coverage and thickness .

 4.conclusions 
 after the electro less plate for a fix time , the Ni - w - p particle deposit on the surface of the sample be see to increase with the plate time .    the particle begin to accumulate , grow , fuse , and have a nodular structure on the surface . during the initial stage of electro - less nickel plate , nickel - phosphorus particle be deposit near the Cu particle and between the Cu particle . zincating process be use for activation of surface and to get fine nodule of the coating . zinc and copper layer be plate before Ni - W - p coating for well adhesion . 
 Hardness be increase with the increase in tungsten content and plating time which can be use to replace some metal and save resource . with increase in plate time , thickness of the coating be increase and porosity be decrease . atomic bind force against plastic deformation be increase by co - deposition of tungsten so that the hardness of the deposit of Ni – W – p be high than the Ni – p deposit and substrate . thus , the property of electro - less ni – p coating be enhance by co - deposition with tungsten . Electro - less ni – p – w plating exhibit a nodular surface profile . corrosion study indicate that as composition of sodium tungstate increase , coating become nobler . as a result , the bonding of Ni – w – p deposit and aluminium substrate be in good condition .

34,Investigation of tribotechnical and corrosion behaviour of material for light-alloy drill pipes,10.17238/issn2541-8416.2018.18.1.21,"Shakirova, Alina I., Ismakov, Rustem A., Agliullin, Akhtyam Kh., Tsenev, Nikolai K.",2018-03-30,"Special aluminum alloys appear to be promising materials for manufacture of high-strength light-alloy drill pipes (HSLADP) that can be used in areas with a severe climate and challenging geology. The effect of using light-alloy drill pipes (LADP) depends directly on the properties of the aluminum alloys from which such pipes are made. As the wells become deeper and horizontal wellbores get longer, use of LADPs becomes more relevant. Since light-alloy pipes are 2.8 times softer than steel pipes, LADPs offer the same performance as steel drill pipes of the lowest strength grade even in the case of rotary drilling. The materials from which such pipes are made have a number of unique advantages: extra light weight in the drill mud, allowing the coefficient of sliding friction between the pipe surface and the borehole wall to be reduced; high corrosion resistance in aggressive media with A high concentration of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide; and high magnetic inductive capacity that allows LADPs to be used as a housing for MWD (measurement while drilling) and LWD (logging while drilling) telemetry systems during well-drilling operations. This study suggests methods for industrial production of submicrocrystalline (SMC) structure in aluminum alloys with the help of severe plastic deformation. Through the example of model aluminum-lithium alloys 1420 (Al-Mg-Li-Zr) and 1460 (Al-Сu-Li-Zr), the researchers demonstrate that SMC structure helps significantly increase resistance to wear and reduce the rate of corrosion depending on the pH value.

The corrosion of aluminum in trichloroacetic acid (TCA) containing methylthymolblue complexon has been studied. In plain trichloroacetic acid, the corrosion rate increases with the acid concentration. At constant acid concentration, the inhibition efficiency (IE) of methylthymolblue complexon increases with the inhibitor concentration. At constant inhibitor concentration, the IE decreases with the increase of acid concentration. As temperature increases, percentage of inhibition decreases. Plot of log (θ/1 - θ) versus log C results in a straight line, suggesting that the inhibitors cover both the anodic and cathodic regions through general adsorption following Langmuir isotherm.

Al-Qawabeha, Taha A. Tabaza, Safwan Moh`d Al-Qawabah, Valentin Shnayder",2020-06-30,"The influence of electrolysis conditions at different electrolyte compositions on the phase formation and properties of coatings obtained by microarc oxidation (MAO) on an aluminum alloy AMg6 was studied. For electrolysis, three types of electrolytes were used: alkaline electrolyte ((KOH) solution in distilled water), silicate electrolyte (with different percentages of Na2SiO3 component) and complex alkaline silicate electrolyte with liquid glass (1÷12 g/l Na2SiO3) and potassium hydroxide (1÷6 g/l KOH). An analysis of the results showed that the choice of electrolyte type and conditions of the microarc oxidation process allows a wide variation in the phase-structural state, thickness and properties of the AMg6 aluminum alloy. The criterion for the expected phase-structural state of the coatings as a result of microarc oxidation is the completeness of the γ–Al2O3→α–Al2O3 transformation process during coating formation. The use of an alkaline electrolyte does not allow achieving a high hardness of the coating due to the formation of the γ-Al2O3 phase and the absence of thermodynamic conditions for the γ–Al2O3→α–Al2O3 transition. When using a silicate electrolyte, it is possible to significantly increase the growth rate of the coating, but at the same time, the presence of a large specific Si concentration stimulates the formation of mullite and an amorphous-like phase. The use of a combined alkaline silicate electrolyte (with different percentages of KOH+Na2SiO3) with a low content (6 g/l) of Na2SiO3 in solution stimulates the formation of mullite. This is manifested to the greatest extent with the lowest content (1 g/l) of the KOH component. At a higher content (2 g/l) of the KOH component, the processes characteristic of an alkaline electrolyte become dominant. This leads to an incomplete transformation reaction and the formation of only the γ-Al2O3 phase. The achievement of the thermodynamic conditions of the γ–Al2O3→α–Al2O3 conversion became possible with an increase in the specific Na2SiO3 content in the electrolyte solution to 12 g/l. In this case, MAO coatings were formed on the AMg6 alloy with the highest hardness of 1500 kg/mm2 and high electric strength of 12 V/μm",https://zenodo.org/api/files/34e14d13-5bfe-4d2a-aa97-235c5027b3d3/A%20study%20of%20the%20electrolyte%20composition%20influence%20on%20the%20structure%20and%20properties%20of%20MAO%20coatings%20formed%20on%20AMg6%20alloy.pdf,pdf,"the influence of electrolysis condition at different electrolyte composition on the phase formation and property of coating obtain by microarc oxidation ( MAO ) on an aluminum alloy amg6 be study . for electrolysis , three type of electrolyte be use : alkaline electrolyte ( ( KOH ) solution in distil water ) , silicate electrolyte ( with different percentage of na2sio3   component ) and complex alkaline silicate electrolyte with liquid glass ( 1÷12   g / l Na2SiO3 ) and potassium hydroxide ( 1÷6   g / l KOH ) . an analysis of the result show that the choice of electrolyte type and condition of the microarc oxidation process allow a wide variation in the phase - structural state , thickness and property of the amg6 aluminum alloy . the criterion for the expect phase - structural state of the coating as a result of microarc oxidation be the completeness of the γ – al2o3→α – al2o3   transformation process during coat formation . the use of an alkaline electrolyte do not allow achieve a high hardness of the coating due to the formation of the γ - al2o3   phase and the absence of thermodynamic condition for the γ – al2o3→α – al2o3   transition . when use a silicate electrolyte , it be possible to significantly increase the growth rate of the coating , but at the same time , the presence of a large specific Si concentration stimulate the formation of mullite and an amorphous - like phase . the use of a combine alkaline silicate electrolyte ( with different percentage of koh+na2sio3 ) with a low content ( 6   g / l ) of Na2SiO3   in solution stimulate the formation of mullite . this be manifest to the great extent with the low content ( 1   g / l ) of the KOH component . at a high content ( 2   g / l ) of the KOH component , the process characteristic of an alkaline electrolyte become dominant . this lead to an incomplete transformation reaction and the formation of only the γ - al2o3   phase . the achievement of the thermodynamic condition of the γ – al2o3→α – al2o3   conversion become possible with an increase in the specific Na2SiO3   content in the electrolyte solution to 12   g / l. in this case , MAO coating be form on the amg6 alloy with the high hardness of 1500   kg / mm2   and high electric strength of 12   V / μm"

The proposal to study the league is justified by the use of it in sectors such as the naval and with that the analysis of its characteristics can bring possibilities of improvements to its properties, revealing positive and negative points, and improve the performance of the alloy during its applications. As a methodology to achieve the objective, four samples of 5052 aluminum were used, one was subjected to annealing, one to normalization, and two to solubilization (one cooled in water while the other in oil). Afterwards, the samples were embedded, sanded, polished and attacked with hydrochloric acid to visualize its microstructure in an optical microscope. As a result, four samples were obtained with different microstructures, the annealed sample showed a greater amount of α phase (rich in aluminum) and precipitated magnesium in the form of dark spots, the normalized sample presented the α phase and the β phase (in vermicular form), the solubilized samples showed a saturated magnesium microstructure (martensitic microstructure).

The fatigue behavior of aluminum alloys at different temperatures is investigated. Thanks to the rapid development of armament in recent years, 7XXX ultra-high strength aluminum alloys are now used more frequently because of their non-corrosive qualities and low weight. Aluminum alloy 7001-T6 behavior is examined at the Company State for Engineering, Rehabilitation, and Inspection (SIER) in Iraq, where chemical analysis of the AA7001 is supported. Most engineering components that operate at high temperatures will eventually fail from fatigue strain, creep damage is a time-dependent process that is primarily influenced by the history of stress and temperature applied to the component. When the two damaging factors combine their effects, This study used AA7001-T6 to conduct experiments on mechanical characteristics (UTS, YS, E, and ductility) and the interaction between creep and fatigue at four distinct temperatures: room temperature (25, 150, 280, and 330) °C, the UTS, YS, and E were lowered by 37.2, 37.2, and 24) %, respectively, as compared to the result at room temperature, but the ductility increased by 28.27 %.

In this research, Syzygium Cumini leaf extract (SCLE) was used as a new green corrosion inhibitor under acidic conditions. The inhibition properties of the novel cumini extract were thoroughly characterized using potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and atomic force microscope (AFM). The results show that the cumini inhibitor has excellent corrosion inhibition with 93 % inhibition efficiency. The adsorption behavior of the inhibitor follows the Langmuir Adsorption Isotherm due to the nearness of R2 to unity. The potentiodynamic and electrochemical measurements demonstrate the mixed type of corrosion inhibitor. Thermodynamic calculation of ΔGads is – 18.41 kJ mol-1 showing the physical adsorption process between the inhibitor and metals. Further inspection of ΔHads at ‒58.93 kJ mol-1 considers releasing energy during adsorption. The FTIR results agree with the increased growth of passive layers due to the adsorption of polyphenol and flavonoids on metals. Remarkably, the adsorption peak at 3266.59 cm-1 corresponds to the adsorption of –OH. The peak at 1612.56 and 1698.4 cm-1 is attributed to C=C and C=O functional groups.

As corrosion is characterized by the destruction of a material as a result of interaction with the environment, one of the expedient methods for its minimization is the use of inhibitors. Therefore, it is a relevant task for environmental protection and economic development of the country to devise effective means to protect metals against corrosion. The reported inhibitor AC-2 (the solution of a mixture of 2-alkylimidazolines in methanol) rather effectively protects steel against corrosion in water-oil mixtures at the high concentrations of mineral salts in water. The efficacy of the inhibitor is almost unaffected by the ratio of the volumes of oil and concentrated aqueous solutions of sodium chloride. When using the inhibitor at a concentration of 50 mg/dm3, the degree of protection of steel against corrosion exceeded 90 %. This is due to the fact that the protection of steel against corrosion occurs through the adsorption of the imidazoline components at the metal surface and the adsorption of organic oil components on the hydrophobic alkyl groups of 2-alkylimidazolines. In this case, the hydrophobization of the metal surface proceeds in the presence of minor quantities of oil. It has been shown that in the mixture that contained 200 cm3 of a 3 % sodium chloride solution and 800 cm3 of oil at the concentration of acetic acid, respectively, 0.5 and 3.0 g/dm3 at a temperature of 80 °C at a dose of the inhibitor of 15‒50 mg/dm3 the efficiency reached 72−92 %.

76,Microstructure and Corrosion Behavior of Laser Welded Magnesium Alloys with Silver Nanoparticles,10.5281/zenodo.1331663,"M. Ishak, K. Yamasaki, K. Maekawa",2010-09-29,"Magnesium alloys have gained increased attention in recent years in automotive, electronics, and medical industry. This because of magnesium alloys have better properties than aluminum alloys and steels in respects of their low density and high strength to weight ratio. However, the main problems of magnesium alloy welding are the crack formation and the appearance of porosity during the solidification. This paper proposes a unique technique to weld two thin sheets of AZ31B magnesium alloy using a paste containing Ag nanoparticles. The paste containing Ag nanoparticles of 5 nm in average diameter and an organic solvent was used to coat the surface of AZ31B thin sheet. The coated sheet was heated at 100 °C for 60 s to evaporate the solvent. The dried sheet was set as a lower AZ31B sheet on the jig, and then lap fillet welding was carried out by using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser in a closed box filled with argon gas. The characteristics of the microstructure and the corrosion behavior of the joints were analyzed by opticalmicroscopy (OM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and immersion corrosion test. The experimental results show that the wrought AZ31B magnesium alloy can be joined successfully using Ag nanoparticles. Ag nanoparticles insert promote grain refinement, narrower the HAZ width and wider bond width compared to weld without and insert. Corrosion rate of welded AZ31B with Ag nanoparticles reduced up to 44 % compared to base metal. The improvement of corrosion resistance of welded AZ31B with Ag nanoparticles due to finer grains and large grain boundaries area which consist of high Al content. β-phase Mg17Al12 could serve as effective barrier and suppressed further propagation of corrosion.

The ICCP system is suitable for coastal applications such as piping systems and offshore structures. In this application, metal surfaces tend to be exposed to seawater. Specific concentrations of seawater can accelerate the occurrence of corrosion of metals, even though they are stainless steel types. This study applied the automatic ICCP system to stainless steel 303. Stainless steel 303 will be immersed in simulated seawater at several concentrations of NaCl (27 ppt, 31 ppt, and 35 ppt). The specimens were immersed in NaCl solution for three weeks or about 504 hours at a constant temperature of 38 °C. After the sample has been soaked, quantitative and qualitative measurements were carried out. Quantitative measures include average weight loss, corrosion rate, and potential value. At the same time, the qualitative measurements include macroscopic, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS). Based on quantitative measures, it was found that the difference in average weight loss and corrosion rate for each NaCl concentration was not very significant. The difference of each parameter is less than 0.1 % and 0.22 %, respectively. The potential value quickly reaches a steady state at NaCl concentrations of 27 ppt and 31 ppt in less than 10 seconds. The results of the SEM test showed a change in the metal structure.

Tabaza, Safwan Moh`d Al-Qawabah",2019-12-31,"Coatings with a thickness of about 100 μm were obtained by microarc oxidation of technically pure aluminum and aluminum alloyed with copper and zinc in an alkaline silicate electrolyte at a current density of ~20 A/dm2. The results of studying the surface morphology, phase composition, and hardness of MAO coatings are presented. The change parameters were the electrolyte composition and the concentration of alloying (Cu and Zn) elements. This study was carried out because the currently available data are not enough to understand the nature of the influence of the chemical composition of the aluminum alloy and electrolysis conditions (in particular, electrolyte composition) on the mechanism and kinetics of γ→α transformation. Without understanding this, a directed change in the structural state and properties of MAO coatings becomes impossible. As a result of the studies, it was found that during microarc oxidation of aluminum alloys in an alkaline electrolyte with the addition of liquid glass (Na2SiO3) of various concentrations, the strengthened layer consists of oxides α-A12O3, γ-A12O3 and mullite 3Al2O3·2SiO2. The data of x-ray diffraction analysis of the coatings indicate the crystal structure of the coatings. It was established that aluminum alloying with copper and zinc significantly affects the phase composition of the coating, changing the quantitative ratio of the phases in a nonlinear manner. The highest content of the α-A12O3 phase (up to 60 vol. %) is achieved by Cu doping. The highest hardness of MAO coatings is achieved using an electrolyte with a composition of 1 g/l KOH and 6 g/l Na2SiO3 in aluminum alloys with a copper content of more than 3 %, and zinc – 2–3 %. It is established that the mechanism of formation of the phase composition should be associated with stabilization and destabilization of the γ-A12O3 phase.

97,A Systematic Approach for Identifying Turning Center Capabilities with Vertical Machining Center in Milling Operation,10.5281/zenodo.2659040,"Joseph Chen, N. Hundal",2014-05-22,"Conventional machining is a form of subtractive manufacturing, in which a collection of material-working processes utilizing power-driven machine tools are used to remove undesired material to achieve a desired geometry. This paper presents an approach for comparison between turning center and vertical machining center by optimization of cutting parameters at cylindrical workpieces leading to minimum surface roughness by using taguchi methodology. Aluminum alloy was taken to conduct experiments due to its unique high strength-weight ratio that is maintained at elevated temperatures and their exceptional corrosion resistance. During testing, the effects of the cutting parameters on the surface roughness were investigated. Additionally, by using taguchi methodology for each of the cutting parameters (spindle speed, depth of cut, insert diameter, and feed rate) minimum surface roughness for the process of turn-milling was determined according to the cutting parameters. A confirmation experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of taguchi method.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/5b499557-d5ae-478d-949f-e3304860531a/5128.pdf,pdf,"conventional machining be a form of subtractive manufacturing , in which a collection of material - work process utilize power - drive machine tool be use to remove undesired material to achieve a desire geometry . this paper present an approach for comparison between turn center and vertical machining center by optimization of cut parameter at cylindrical workpiece lead to minimum surface roughness by use taguchi methodology . aluminum alloy be take to conduct experiment due to its unique high strength - weight ratio that be maintain at elevated temperature and their exceptional corrosion resistance . during testing , the effect of the cut parameter on the surface roughness be investigate . additionally , by use taguchi methodology for each of the cut parameter ( spindle speed , depth of cut , insert diameter , and feed rate ) minimum surface roughness for the process of turn - milling be determine accord to the cut parameter . a confirmation experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of taguchi method ."
99,Characterization Study of Aluminium 6061 Hybrid Composite,10.5281/zenodo.1107183,"U. Achutha Kini, S. S. Sharma, K. Jagannath, P. R. Prabhu, Gowri Shankar M. C.",2015-06-02,"Aluminium matrix composites with alumina
reinforcements give superior mechanical & physical properties. Their
applications in several fields like automobile, aerospace, defense,
sports, electronics, bio-medical and other industrial purposes are
becoming essential for the last several decades. In the present work,
fabrication of hybrid composite was done by Stir casting technique
using Al 6061 as a matrix with alumina and silicon carbide (SiC) as
reinforcement materials. The weight percentage of alumina is varied
from 2 to 4% and the silicon carbide weight percentage is maintained
constant at 2%. Hardness and wear tests are performed in the as cast
and heat treated conditions. Age hardening treatment was performed
on the specimen with solutionizing at 550°C, aging at two
temperatures (150 and 200°C) for different time durations. Hardness
distribution curves are drawn and peak hardness values are recorded.
Hardness increase was very sensitive with respect to the decrease in
aging temperature. There was an improvement in wear resistance of
the peak aged material when aged at lower temperature. Also
increase in weight percent of alumina, increases wear resistance at
lower temperature but opposite behavior was seen when aged at
higher temperature.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/d4eac8ce-10d0-43c9-9787-5e31729aac90/10001700.pdf,pdf,"aluminium matrix composite with alumina
