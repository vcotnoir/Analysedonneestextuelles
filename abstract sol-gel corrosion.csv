B.",2018-01-01,"The properties and wide application range of organic-inorganic hybrid (O-IH) sol-gel materials have attracted significant attention over the past decades. The combination of organic polymers and inorganic materials in a single-phase provides exceptional possibilities to tailor electrical, optical and mechanical properties concerning diverse applications. This unlimited design concept has led to the development of diverse coatings for several applications such as glasses, and metals to mitigate mechanical abrasion, erosion and corrosion. This class of materials could be easily obtained by sol-gel method at mild synthesis conditions. Furthermore, the large variety of available chemical precursors allows producing a diversity of coatings with tuned mechanical and thermal properties. This chapter will introduce the fundamentals of the sol-gel method to produce O-IH protective thin coatings and discuss the methodologies used to apply these materials onto different metallic substrates for erosion and corrosion protection.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/a1205a0d-0b91-43f5-98d8-7d103e043ced/article.pdf,pdf

Sol-gel silica glass has a significant effect on the microstructural and mechanical development of the implant materials. Sol-gel method is a versatile method to develop different types of oxide coatings on a large, curved substrates with high homogeneity and low sintering temperatures. In order to enhance the corrosion resistance behavior various types of oxide based, hybrid coatings have been studied. There are a number of interesting studies including the biological functions; biomineralisation with excellent bioactive ability and mechanical strength makes it suitable for biomedical applications. The aim of the work is to enhance the corrosion resistive behavior of the coatings using different strategies such as EPD method, spin coating and biomimetic coating. Silica glass is prepared at a molar ratio of H2O/TEOS (Tetra Ethyl Ortho Silicate) and the obtained powder was characterized by FT-IR, XRD and SEM analysis. It was found that the sol-gel spin coatings have shown excellent thermal stability, oxidation control and enhanced corrosion resistance on metal substrates. The ability to passivate the metal substrates during coating has pronounced effect on corrosion resistance. The corrosion resistance behavior of the coatings was determined by (1) open-circuit potential versus time of exposure, (2) electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, (3) cyclic polarization in Ringer’s solution.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/9d0f1ba8-6a36-4f61-9ef2-45ea1dc70c72/687-690.pdf,pdf

Sodium alginate sol can be converted into ionotropic gel through the diffusion of a di- or trivalent metal ion. The kinetics or this process can be studied by two different methods. The first is the analytical method in which the decrease of the divalent metal ion concentration with time during the exchange process with sodium alginate sol is followed complexometrically. It is found that the rate of gel formation is greater at first during the primary gel membrane formation, and it depends on both the electrolyte and the sol concentration. The rate then decreases during the further gel growth and becomes constant whatever the concentration or the electrolyte is. This may be attributed to the diffusion control through the primary gel membrane. The second method is the drop density method in which the rate of density variation or a sol drop during its contact with the electrolyte solution is taken as a measure or ionotropic gel growth. The drop density method is carried out at different temperatures, and the rate of growth is found to increase by raising temperature. The activation energy is calculated and found to have the values between (13-20 k.j./Mole).",https://zenodo.org/api/files/423cd866-0912-4025-b60d-89969e9130b8/728-731.pdf,pdf

Mesoporous carbon xerogels were synthesised using paraformaldehyde and resorcinol as precursors. Organic gel was obtained by sol-gel processing of the precursors. The wet gel was dried and then carbonized under nitrogen flow to obtain carbon xerogel. A series of carbon xerogels was synthesised by varying pH of sol-gel processing in the range of 5.5 to 6.3. One carbon xerogel was activated by nitric acid and subsequently heated at elevated temperatures (200 to 300ºC) under vacuum to obtain another series of carbon xerogels. All the carbon xerogels were characterised by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm measurement. The carbon xerogels were found to be significantly mesoporous.

Sol-gel transitions were performed at 120 ºC and room temperature. All g-Al2O3 samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption and thermal analysis. Our results showed that temperature of both water and alkoxide has not much influence on the nanostructure of the final g-Al2O3, thus giving a structure very similar to that of samples obtained by the reference method as long as the reaction temperature above 75 ºC is reached soon enough. XRD characterization showed diffraction patterns corresponding to g-Al2O3 for all samples. Also BET specific area values (253-280 m2/g) were similar to those obtained by Yoldas’s original method. The temperature of the sol-gel transition does not affect the resulting sample structure, and crystalline boehmite particles were identified in all dried gels.

nanocomposite coatings were electrodeposited on mild steel using a
novel sol enhanced electroplating method. In this method, transparent
Al2O3 sol was added into the acidic Zn-Ni bath to produced Zn-Ni-
Al2O3 nanocomposite coatings. The effect of alumina sol on the
electrodeposition process, and coating properties was investigated
using cyclic voltammetry, XRD, ESEM and Tafel test. Results from
XRD tests showed that the structure of all coatings was single γ-
Ni5Zn21 phase. Cyclic voltammetry results showed that the
electrodeposition overpotential was lower in the presence of alumina
sol in the bath, and caused the reduction potential of Zn-Ni to shift to
more positive values. Zn-Ni-Al2O3 nanocomposite coatings produced
more uniform and compact deposits, with fine grained microstructure
when compared to Zn-Ni coatings. The corrosion resistance of Zn-Ni
coatings was improved significantly by incorporation of alumina
nanoparticles into the coatings.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/a9adb70d-c3de-4282-a973-d47f49188c47/10001993.pdf,pdf

The aim of this research is to find out the quality of the thin film based on the number of cycles (3, 4, 5, and 6 cycles) and annealing temperature (300, 400 and 500 °C). The variation of annealing temperature and number of cycles can affect the crystal structure of the FTO thin film, crystal size and grain size. Increasing the number of cycles and annealing temperature can lead to larger crystallite size and lower dislocation density, so that electrons between the grains can move easily. The large grain can reduce the grain boundary, increasing the electron mobility and decreasing the resistivity. XRD analysis shows that the structure of SnO2 polycrystalline with the most dominant crystal plane (110) is formed in this research when compared to the intensity of other structures. The resistivity value decreases with increasing the annealing temperature and number of cycles. In addition, transparency value also decreases along with increasing the annealing temperature and number of cycles. The optimum results of resistivity and transparency values obtained in this research are 1.692´10-2 Ω×cm and 69.232 % at 500 °C and 5 cycles. These results can be used as a reference for further study to optimize the production of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) thin film with spin coating.

Glass-forming ability and structural features of melt-quenched and gel-derived SiO2-TiO2 glasses
Abstract
SiO2-TiO2 glasses produced by melt-quenching or sol-gel spray-drying were compared to highlight their structural differences. Glass formation was possible by melt-quenching up to 10 mol% TiO2, while higher contents led to devitrification. Raman spectroscopy and solid-state 17O and 29Si MAS NMR confirmed the clear emergence of Ti-O-Si bonds and a tetrahedral oxygen coordination of Ti4+ leading to full network connectivity, as also substantiated by the synthesis of TiO2-doped cristobalite. In gel-derived glasses, water content induced partial network depolymerization, thereby enhancing the solubility of TiO2 in the hydrous silicate matrix. However, full dehydration during heating proved challenging due to the competing devitrification tendency: the glass-forming range in the anhydrous binary SiO2-TiO2 system does not therefore appear to be significantly enlarged by the sol-gel synthesis route.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/eea7fbcb-fdfb-4cd8-bc2f-52d7c0d35650/Research%20Data%2C%20GCA%20SiO2-TiO2%20glasses.zip,zip

SnCl4 aqueous solution was precipitated by ammonia under sonication, which continued for 2 h. A part of the sample was then dried and calcined at 400°C for 1.5 h and characterized by XRD and BET. The average particle size and the specific surface area of the SnO2 QDs as well as their sensing properties were compared with the SnO2 nano-particles which were prepared by conventional sol-gel method. The BET surface area of sonochemically as-prepared product and the one calcined at 400°C after 1.5 hr are 257 m2/gr and 212 m2/gr respectively while the specific surface area for SnO2 nanoparticles prepared by conventional sol-gel method is about 80m2/gr.

However, for the sample prepared by sol-gel method and calcined at 400°C SnO crystals are detected along with those of SnO2. Quantum dots of SnO2 show exceedingly high sensitivity to CO with different concentrations of 100, 300 and 1000 ppm in whole range of temperature (25- 350°C). At 50°C a sensitivity of 27 was obtained for 1000 ppm CO, which increases to a maximum of 147 when the temperature rises to 225°C and then drops off while the maximum sensitivity for the SnO2 sample prepared by the sol-gel method was obtained at 300°C with the amount of 47.2.

K. W. Roelants, Wim Soetaert, Niki Baccile",2022-06-13,"Self-assembled fibrillar network (SAFIN) hydrogels and organogels are commonly obtained by a crystallization process into fibers induced by external stimuli like temperature or pH. The gel-to-sol-to-gel transition is generally readily reversible and the change rate of the stimulus determines the fiber homogeneity and eventual elastic properties of the gels. However, recent work shows that in some specific cases, fibrillation occurs for a given molecular conformation and the sol-to-gel transition depends on the relative energetic stability of one conformation over the other, and not on the rate of change of the stimuli. We observe such a phenomenon on a class of bolaform glycolipids, sophorosides, similar to the well-known sophorolipid biosurfactants, but composed of two symmetric sophorose units. A combination of oscillatory rheology, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and in situ rheo-SAXS using synchrotron radiation shows that below 14°C, twisted nanofibers are the thermodynamic phase. Between 14°C and about 33°C, nanofibers coexist with micelles and a strong hydrogel forms, the sol-to-gel transition being readily reversible in this temperature range. However, above the annealing temperature of about 40°C, the micelle morphology becomes kinetically-trapped over hours, even upon cooling, whichever the rate, to 4°C. A combination of solution and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) suggests two different conformations of the 1ˈˈ, 1ˈ and 2ˈ carbon stereocenters of sophorose, precisely at the β(1,2) glycosidic bond, for which several combinations of the dihedral angles are known to provide at least three energetic minima of comparable magnitude and each corresponding to a given sophorose conformation.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/fcb79b97-bdee-4226-875d-6fa8e31e3b8a/Figures.pptx,pptx

Manuscript received 13 September 1993
The synthesis of bimetallic alkoxides has been followed by the preparation of intriguingly stable heterometal alkoxides containing three or four different metal atoms in the same molecular species, which has led to the possibility of molecularly designing a single source precursor suited to the composition of the targeted final ceramic. This has been made feasible by the extraordinary stability of the framework of heterometal alkoxides, which appears to remain intact during the initial hydrolysis reactions in the S-G process. The characterisation (by sophisticated physicochemical techniques including X-Ray crystal structure elucidation in some cases) of heterometal alkoxides appears to have added a new dimension to heterometal coordination systems which appear to be uniquely stable without the presence of metal-metal bonds or auxiliary ligands like CO, etc., enerally required for stabilising polymetallic systems known so far.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/13e62c80-2c02-409e-a6c0-8f765254e7a6/315-321.pdf,pdf

In order to compare the effect of the crystallisation step on oxygen vacancies and conductivity, two different annealing conditions have been undertaken: under a high Ar flow (“TiO2 Fibres-A” sample) and under static Ar (“TiO2 Fibres B” sample). Moreover, these materials have been compared with individualised TiO2 nanoparticles prepared by a sol-gel procedure. CO and H2 are detected as major products with all photocatalysts, with lower amounts of CH4 and CH3OH. The TiO2 nanofibres exhibit better results than the sol-gel photocatalyst, behaviour that may be ascribed to an improved nanocrystals connection, which favours a fast charge transport along the grain boundaries, as measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The highest CO2 reduction activity is achieved with the TiO2 Fibres B catalyst, which gives rise to ca. 4 and 2.5 times higher H2 and CO production, respectively, than the TiO2 Fibres-A one. This sample is composed of a mixture of anatase and rutile crystalline phases (80:20), leading to a decrease in the electron-hole recombination rate observed by photoluminescence (PL) measurements.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/e660baa3-f527-41b2-a709-98f61cfe3699/1._ELSEVIER_JCO_FINAL.pdf,pdf

The most prevalent is tetraethoxysilane. The applications for tetraalkoxysilanes are classified roughly by whether the Si–OR bond is expected to remain intact or be hydrolyzed in the final application. Applications in which the Si–OR bond is hydrolyzed include as binders for foundry-mold sands used in investment and thin-shell castings; as binders for refractories; and as resins, coatings, sol–gel glasses, cross-linking agents, and adhesion promoters. Applications in which the Si–OR bond remains intact include as heat-transfer and hydraulic fluids. The hydrolysis reaction, which yields polymers of silicic acid that can be dehydrated to silicon dioxide, is of considerable commercial importance. The chemistry and properties of alkoxysilanes and related acyloxysilanes and aspects of commercial production and utilization are reviewed. Sol–gel technology is discussed.

The sol has a tendency to yield gels simply by prolonged dialysis, coagulation with suitable amounts of electrolytes, or by simply warming at a certain stage of parity. The results are significant for the measurements of the rate of flow through capillary where it is definitely shown that when the sol begins to deviate from the Poiseulle's law for fluids, either for its concentration or purity, it yields gels.

The measured specific surface area and averaged particle size were 63.44m2/g and 23.94nm, respectively. Based on the scanning electron microscope images and x-ray diffraction patterns, it is believed that the onset temperature of the phase transition to α-Al2O3 was existed near 1200oC. The averaged diameters of the sintered particles heat treated at 1,260oC were approximately 80nm.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/24120920-be31-40c5-81af-4682747e3b85/16864.pdf,pdf

wide application range, because it has unique properties, for example,
wear-resistance, dielectric characteristics, and exploitation ability at
high temperatures and in corrosive atmosphere. Low temperature
synthesis of α-Al2O3 is energo-economical process and it is topical
for developing technologies of corundum ceramics fabrication. In the present work possibilities of low temperature transformation
of oxyhydroxides in α-Al2O3, during the presence of small amount of
rare–earth elements compounds (also Th, Re), have been discussed.
Aluminum unstable oxyhydroxides have been obtained by hydrolysis
of aluminium isopropoxide, nitrates, sulphate, and chloride in
alkaline environment at 80-90ºC temperatures. β-Al(OH)3 has been
received from aluminum powder by ultrasonic development. Drying
of oxyhydroxide sol has been conducted with presence of various
types seeds, which amount reaches 0,1-0,2% (mas). Neodymium,
holmium, thorium, lanthanum, cerium, gadolinium, disprosium
nitrates and rhenium carbonyls have been used as seeds and they
have been added to the sol specimens in amount of 0.1-0.2% (mas)
calculated on metals. Annealing of obtained gels is carried out at 70–
1100ºC for 2 hrs. The same specimen transforms in α-Al2O3 at
1100ºC. At this temperature in case of presence of lanthanum and
gadolinium transformation takes place by 70-85%. In case of
presence of thorium stabilization of γ-and θ-phases takes place. It is
established, that thorium causes inhibition of α-phase generation at
1100ºC, and at the time when in all other doped specimens α-phase is
generated at lower temperatures (1000-1050ºC). Synthesis of various
type compounds and simultaneous consolidation has developed in the

Muhamed Shajudheen, K. Viswanathan, K. Anitha Rani, A. Uma Maheswari, S. Saravana Kumar",2016-03-01,"In this paper, a simple chemical precipitation route for the preparation of titanium dioxide nanoparticles, synthesized by using titanium tetra isopropoxide as a precursor and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as a capping agent, is reported. The Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) of the samples were recorded and the phase transformation temperature of titanium hydroxide, Ti(OH)4 to titanium oxide, TiO2 was investigated. The as-prepared Ti(OH)4 precipitate was annealed at 800°C to obtain TiO2 nanoparticles. The thermal, structural, morphological and textural characterizations of the TiO2 nanoparticle samples were carried out by different techniques such as DSC-TGA, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy (FTIR), Micro Raman spectroscopy, UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and Field Effect Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) techniques. The as-prepared precipitate was characterized using DSC-TGA and confirmed the mass loss of around 30%. XRD results exhibited no diffraction peaks attributable to anatase phase, for the reaction products, after the solvent removal. The results indicate that the product is purely rutile. The vibrational frequencies of two main absorption bands of prepared samples are discussed from the results of the FTIR analysis. The formation of nanosphere of diameter of the order of 10 nm, has been confirmed by FESEM. The optical band gap was found by using UV-Visible spectrum. From photoluminescence spectra, a strong emission was observed.

                    Background: Micro-texturing is an increasingly used technique that aims at improving the functional behaviour of components during their useful life, and it is applied in different industrial manufacturing processes for different purposes, such as reducing friction on dynamic rubber seals for pneumatic equipment, among others. Micro-texturing is produced on polymer components by transfer from the mould and might critically increase the adhesion and friction between the moulded rubber part with the mould, provoking issues during demoulding, both on the mould itself and on the rubber part. The mould design, the coating release agent applied to the mould surface, and the operational parameters of the moulding/demoulding process, are fundamental aspects to avoid problems and guarantee a correct texture transfer during the demoulding process. 
                    Methods: In this work, the lack of knowledge about demoulding processes was addressed with an in-house test rig and a robust experimental procedure to measure demoulding forces (DFs) as well as the final quality of the moulded part, between thermoset polymers and moulds. After the characterization of several Sol-Gel coating formulations (inorganic; hybrid) the influence of several parameters was analysed experimentally, i.e.: Sol-Gel efficiency, texture effects, pattern geometry, roughness and material compound. 
                    Results: The results obtained from the experimental studies revealed that texture depth is the most critical geometrical parameter, showing high scatter among the selected compounds. Finally, the experimental results were used to compute a model through reduced order modelling (ROM) technique for the prediction of DFs. 
                    Conclusions: The characterization of DFs in a laboratory, with a specific device operated by a universal testing machine (UTM), provided valuable information that allows a fast and optimized introduction of texturing in rubber components. Selection of a novel Sol-Gel coating and the use of the ROM technique contributed to speed up implementation for mass production.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/2eea77fc-e4ba-4bd9-bdda-29c17bc3f36b/openreseurope-1-14790.pdf,pdf

Solar energy is one of the cornerstones for the world’s economic growth because of its abundancy with zero carbon pollution. Among the various solar energy conversion technologies, solar thermal technology has attracted a substantial renewed interest due to its diversity and compatibility in various applications. Solar thermal systems employ concentrators, tracking systems and heat engines for electricity generation which lead to high cost and complexity in comparison with photovoltaics; however, it is compatible with distinct thermal energy storage capability and dispatchable electricity which creates a tremendous attraction. Apart from that, employing cost-effective solar selective receiver tube in a concentrating solar thermal (CST) system improves the energy conversion efficiency and directly reduces the cost of technology. In addition, the development of solar receiver tubes by low cost methods which can offer high optical properties and corrosion resistance in an open-air atmosphere would be beneficial for low and medium temperature applications. In this regard, our work opens up an approach which has the potential to achieve cost-effective energy conversion. We have developed a highly selective tandem absorber coating through a facile wet chemical route by a combination of chemical oxidation, sol-gel, and nanoparticle coating methods. The developed tandem absorber coating has gradient refractive index nature on stainless steel (SS 304) and exhibited high optical properties (α ≤ 0.95 & ε ≤ 0.14). The first absorber layer (Cr-Mn-Fe oxides) developed by controlled oxidation of SS 304 in a chemical bath reactor. A second composite layer of ZrO2-SiO2 has been applied on the chemically oxidized substrate by So-gel dip coating method to serve as optical enhancing and corrosion resistant layer. Finally, an antireflective layer (MgF2) has been deposited on the second layer, to achieve > 95% of absorption. The developed tandem layer exhibited good thermal stability up to 250 °C in open air atmospheric condition and superior corrosion resistance (withstands for > 200h in salt spray test (ASTM B117)). After the successful development of a coating with targeted properties at a laboratory scale, a prototype of the 1 m tube has been demonstrated with excellent uniformity and reproducibility. Moreover, it has been validated under standard laboratory test condition as well as in field condition with a comparison of the commercial receiver tube. The presented strategy can be widely adapted to develop highly selective coatings for a variety of CST applications ranging from hot water, solar desalination, and industrial process heat and power generation. The high-performance, cost-effective medium temperature receiver tube technology has attracted many industries, and recently the technology has been transferred to Indian industry.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/bfb7c658-6131-4874-b00b-d6d7bde79de6/10010587.pdf,pdf
98,PHOTOCHEMICAL STUDIES IN GELS. PART I. THE REDUCTION OF FERRIC CHLORIDE BY MANDELIC ACID IN LIGHT OF DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES IN THORIUM PHOSPHATE GEL AS A SOLVENT MEDIUM,10.5281/zenodo.6597907,"J. C. GHOSH, S. K. BHATTACHARYYA",1943-12-31,The kinetics of the reduction of ferric chloride by mandelic add in light of frequencies 366 and 436 μμ in transparent and colourless thorium phosphate gel have been studied. The reaction was found to be zero molecular and the velocity constant was found to increase with increasing concentrations of ferric chloride and in fact \({\bigtriangleup x \over \bigtriangleup t}/I_{abc}\) was found to remain constant for a particular wave-length which increase with increased in the magnitude of the quanta absorbed. The velocity constant also increases with increasing concentration of mandelic acid and was directly proportional to the intensity of absorbed radiation. The quantum efficiency was found to be very low. The results were compared with those obtained in thorium phosphate sol before gelation and in aqueous solution. The rate of reaction was found to be the same in both sol and gel states of thorium phosphate but in water it was considerably greater. The extinction coefficients of ferric chloride in presence of excess mandelic acid were measured in all the three media. A mechanism has been suggested.,https://zenodo.org/api/files/3f445a68-0896-4d54-9181-47e2c0f041b6/377-381.pdf,pdf
99,Influence of annealing temperature on the sensitivity of nickel  oxide nanosheet films in humidity sensing applications,10.11591/ijeecs.v18.i1.pp284-292,"N. Parimon, M. H. Mamat, A. S. Ismail, I. B. Shameem Banu, M. K. Ahmad, A. B. Suriani, M. Rusop",2020-04-01,"Nickel oxide (NiO) nanosheet films were successfully grown onto NiO seedcoated glass substrates at different annealing temperatures for humidity sensing applications. NiO seed layers and NiO nanosheet films were prepared using a sol-gel spin coating and sonicated sol-gel immersion techniques, respectively. The properties of NiO nanosheet films at asdeposited, 300 ℃, and 500 ℃-annealed were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), ultravioletvisible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, and humidity sensor measurement system. The XRD patterns demonstrate that the grown NiO films have crystalline cubic structures at temperature of 300 ℃ and 500 ℃. The FESEM images show that the large porous nanosheet network spread over the layers as the annealing temperature increased. The UV-vis spectra revealed that all the nanosheet films have the average transmittance below than 50% in the visible region, with absorption edges ~ 350 nm. The optical band gap energy was evaluated in ranges of 3.39 to 3.61 eV. From the obtained humidity sensing results, it shows that 500 ℃-annealed film exhibited the best sensitivity of 257, as well as the slowest response time, and the fastest recovery time compared with others.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/e4d7ec62-965d-44ca-949d-203c532e224f/32%2021119.pdf,pdf
