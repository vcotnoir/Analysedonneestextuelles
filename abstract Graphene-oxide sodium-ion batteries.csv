1,"Synthesis and Electrochemical Behavior in Redox Reaction with Lithium of K, Na (V-Oxide Compounds)",10.5281/zenodo.4455852,"Kuznetsov, Yu. A., Apostolova, R.D., Shembel, E.M.",2021-01-15,"Heterogeneous vanadium-oxide compounds (bronzes, vanadates) attract the attention of developers of lithium batteries due to an increased structural stability of those oxides in the redox reaction with lithium as compared with the resistance of V2O5 oxide, a traditional intercalation electrode material for Li-batteries. Structural stabilization improves the discharge characteristics of Li-batteries based on potassium-containing and sodium-containing vanadium oxide compounds. In this work, the combined effect of potassium and sodium ions on the electrochemical transformation of vanadium oxide compounds in electrodes for usage in a Li-battery was investigated. According to the data of the X-ray phase analysis, dispersed deposits were obtained at the anode, depending on the composition of the electrolyte. From the solutions of potassium metavanadate in the presence of sodium ions, the deposits contain Na5V12O32 and KV5O13 vanadates; from the solutions of vanadyl sulfate in the presence of potassium and sodium ions, vanadates Na10V24O64 and KV5O13 are formed. The evaluation of the electrochemical parameters of the synthesized material indicates the possibility of its use  in Li-batteries. The cycling efficiency of vanadates obtained from vanadyl sulfate solutions in thin-layer ballastless electrodes of a lithium battery exceeds that of V2O5 oxide. The positive combined potassium-sodium effect can be useful for the implementation of thin-layer lithium batteries based on electrochemically synthesized K, Na (V-oxide compounds) obtained from a solution of vanadyl sulfate.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/1b0bbab8-5ace-4175-9b27-054b45988a1a/article_4.pdf,pdf
2,Data from: Exfoliated transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets for supercapacitor and sodium ion battery applications,10.5061/dryad.tv2tk65,"Mukherjee, Santanu, Turnley, Jonathan, Mansfield, Elisabeth, Holm, Jason, David, Lamuel, Singh, Gurpreet",2019-07-18,"Growing concerns regarding the safety, flammability, and hazards posed by Li-ion systems have led to research on alternative rechargeable metal-ion electrochemical storage technologies. Among the most notable of these are Na-ion supercapacitors and batteries, motivated in part because of the similar size and electrochemistry of Li and Na ions. However, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) come with their own set of issues, especially the large size of the Na+ ion, its relatively sluggish kinetics and low energy densities. This makes the development of novel materials and appropriate electrode architecture is of absolute significance. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), in this regard have attracted a lot of attention due of their relative ease of exfoliation, diverse morphologies and architectures with superior electronic properties. Here, we study the electrochemical performance of Mo based two dimensional (2D) layered TMDs (e.g. MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2), exfoliated in a superacid, for battery and supercapacitor applications.  The exfoliated TMD flakes were interfaced with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to be used as composite electrodes. Electron microscopy, elemental mapping, Raman spectra were used to analyze the exfoliated material and confirm the formation of 2D TMD/rGO layer morphology. For supercapacitor applications in aqueous media, the sulfide-based TMD (MoS2) exhibited the best performance, providing an areal capacitance of 60.25 mF cm-2. For SIB applications, TMD electrodes exhibited significantly high charge capacities than the neat rGO electrode. The initial desodiation capacities for the composite electrodes 468.84 mAh g-1 (1687.82 C g-1),  399.10 mAh g-1 (1436.76 C g-1) and 387.36 mAh g-1 (1394.49 C g-1) for MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 respectively.

5,A review of hard carbon anode materials for sodium-ion batteries and their environmental assessment,10.5281/zenodo.4575369,"Peters, Jens F., Abdelbaky, Mohammad, Baumann, Manuel, Weil, Marcel",2021-03-03,"Sodium-ion batteries are increasingly being promoted as a promising alternative to current lithium-ion batteries. The substitution of lithium by sodium offers potential advantages under environmental aspects due to its higher abundance and availability. However, sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries cannot rely on graphite for the anodes, requiring amorphous carbon materials (hard carbons). Since no established market exists for hard carbon anode materials, these are synthesised individually for each Na-ion battery from selected precursors. The hard carbon anode has been identified as a relevant driver for environmental impacts of sodium-ion batteries in a recent work, where a significant improvement potential was found by minimising the impacts of the hard carbon synthesis process. In consequence, this work provides a detailed process model of hard carbon synthesis processes as basis for their environmental assessment. Starting from a review of recent studies about hard carbon synthesis processes from different precursors, three promising materials are evaluated in detail. For those, the given laboratory synthesis processes are scaled up to a hypothetical industrial level, obtaining detailed energy and material balances. The subsequent environmental assessment then quantifies the potential environmental impacts of the different hard carbon materials and their potential for further improving the environmental performance of future Na-ion batteries by properly selecting the hard carbon material. Especially organic waste materials (apple pomace) show a high potential as precursor for hard carbon materials, potentially reducing environmental impacts of Na-ion cells between 10 and 40% compared to carbohydrate (sugar) based hard carbons (the hard carbon material used by the current reference work). Waste tyres are also found to be a promising hard carbon precursor, but require a more complex pre-treatment prior to carbonisation, why they do not reach the same performance as the pomace based one. Finally, hard carbons obtained from synthetic resins, another promising precursor, score significantly worse. They obtain results in the same order of magnitude as the sugar based hard carbon, mainly due to the high emissions and energy intensity of the resin production processes.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/565a8a41-88b5-43ae-9a74-6eb4ac75a9dc/Peters%20Abdelbaky%20et%20al.%2020191.pdf,pdf

These columns will be oriented toward the vapor source because of the self-shadowing effect, and they are homogenously distributed on the substrate surface because of the limited surface diffusion ability of ad-atoms when there is no additional substrate heating.
In this work, the oblique angle electron beam evaporation technique is used to fabricate thin films containing inclined nanorods. The results demonstrate that depending on the thin film composition, the morphology of the nanorods is changed as well. The galvanostatic analysis of these thin film anodes reveals that a composite CuSn nanorods having approximately 900mAhg-1 of initial discharge capacity, performs higher electrochemical performance compared to pure Sn nanorods containing anode material. The long cycle life and the advanced electrochemical properties of the nanostructured composite electrode might be attributed to its improved mechanical tolerance and enhanced electrical conductivity depending on the Cu presence in the nanorods.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/b71d9137-9af6-42c8-bd9c-345b59d67347/9996650.pdf,pdf

The aerogels were obtained by freeze/freeze-drying a suspension of graphene oxide (GO) in the presence of a tin precursor and its subsequent thermal reduction under an argon atmosphere. The materials exhibited a 3D-macroporous structure formed by the walls of rGO decorated with Sn or SnO2 particles depending on the temperature of calcination. Self-standing compressed foams were directly assembled into coin cells without using any metallic support to be evaluated as binder-free anodes for LIBs.

The use of aqueous electrolytes instead of organics ensures the safety, low price and environmental friendliness of such systems. Exploration and development of suitable positive and negative electrode materials are critically important for high-performance of Na-ion batteries. A great variety of polyanionic or mixed-polyanion compounds have been investigated as cathodes for such batteries. However almost all of them still face different challenges such as poor stability, low energy density or voltage [1]. Among different Fe-based phosphates (Na2FeP2O7, Na3Fe2(PO4)3 and etc.), the mixed-polyanionic Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) represents a more attractive option since it possesses the highest discharge voltage (3.1 V vs Na+/Na), favorable theoretical capacity (129 mAh g−1) and suitable 3D structure with low volume change during sodium insertion [2, 3].
In this work, we prepared pure phase Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) via solid-state and sol-gel synthesis methods using different Fe-based precursors (Fe(CH3COO)2, FeC2O4‧2H2O and C4H2FeO4). The structure and morphology of prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1), scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The electrochemical properties of prepared electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, charge/discharge galvanostatic cycling and impedance spectroscopy.

23,Silicon-Reduced Graphene Oxide Self-Standing Composites Suitable as Binder-Free Anodes for Lithium-Ion Batteries,10.1021/acsami.6b07910,"Botas, Cristina, Carriazo, Daniel, Zhang, Wei, Rojo, Teófilo, Singh, Gurpreet",2016-10-06,"Silicon-reduced graphene oxide (Si-rGO) composites processed as selfstanding aerogels (0.2 g cm−3) and films (1.5 g cm−3) have been prepared by the thermal reduction of composites formed between silicon nanoparticles and a suspension of graphene oxide (GO) in ethanol. The characterization of the samples by different techniques (X-ray diffraction, Raman, thermogravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy) show that in both cases the composites are formed by rGO sheets homogeneously decorated with 50 nm silicon nanoparticles with silicon contents of ∼40% wt. The performances of these self-standing materials were tested as binder-free anodes in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in a half cell configuration under two different galvanostatic charge−discharge cutoff voltages (75 and 50 mV). The results show that the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is favored in composites processed as aerogels due to its large exposed surface, which prevents the activation of silicon when they are cycled within the 2 to 0.075 V voltage windows. It is also found that the composites processed in the form of self-standing films exhibit good stability over the first 100 cycles, high reversible specific capacity per mass of electrode (∼750 mAh g−1), areal capacities that reach 0.7 mAh cm−2, and high Coulombic efficiencies (80% for the first charge−discharge cycle and over 99% in the subsequent cycles).",https://zenodo.org/api/files/f183d04e-e979-454d-9edb-3514f6ecb42a/2016_Botas_ACSApplMaterInterfaces_28800.pdf,pdf
24,Driving the sodium-oxygen battery chemistry towards the efficient formation of discharge products: The importance of sodium superoxide quantification,10.1016/j.jechem.2021.12.014,"Marina Enterría, Marine Reynaud, Juan Ignacio Paredes, Lidia Medinilla, Reza Younesi, Nagore Ortiz-Vitoriano",2021-12-16,"Sodium-oxygen batteries (SOBs) have the potential to provide energy densities higher than the state-ofthe-art Li-ion batteries. However, controlling the formation of sodium superoxide (NaO2) as the sole discharge product on the cathode side is crucial to achieve durable and efficient SOBs. In this work, the discharge efficiency of two graphene-based cathodes was evaluated and compared with that of a commercial gas diffusion layer. The discharge products formed at the surface of these cathodes in a glyme-based electrolyte were carefully studied using a range of characterization techniques. NaO2 was detected as the main discharge product regardless of the specific cathode material while small amounts of Na2O22H2O and carbonate-like side-products were detected by X-ray diffraction as well as by Raman and infrared spectroscopies. This work leverages the use of X-ray diffraction to determine the actual yield of NaO2 which is usually overlooked in this type of batteries. Thus, the proper quantification of the superoxide formed on the cathode surface is widely underestimated; even though is crucial for determining the efficiency of the battery while eliminating the parasitic chemistry in SOBs. Here, we develop an ex-situ analysis method to determine the amount of NaO2 generated upon discharge in SOBs by transmission X-ray diffraction and quantitative Rietveld analysis. This work unveils that the yield of NaO2 depends on the depth of discharge where high capacities lead to very low discharge efficiency, regardless of the used cathode. We anticipate that the methodology developed herein will provide a convenient diagnosis tool in future efforts to optimize the performance of the different cell components in SOBs.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/4f5f2cc4-c9d4-4e0a-ac0a-a295e3e5d6fc/Enterria%20et%20al%20_JEC2022.pdf,pdf

Nevertheless, detailed studies on how to link synthesis temperature, structure and electrochemistry are still rare. Herein, we present a study on P-type NaxNi0.22Co0.11Mn0.66O2 materials, investigating the influence of synthesis temperature on their structure and electrochemical performance. The change of annealing temperature leads to various materials of different morphologies and either P3-type (700 C), P3/P2-type (750 C) or P2-type (800–900 C) structure. Galvanostatic cycling of P3-type materials revealed high initial capacities but also a high capacity fade per cycle leading to a poor long-term cycling performance. In contrast, pure P2-type NaxNi0.22Co0.11Mn0.66O2, synthesized at 800 C, exhibits lower initial capacities but a stable cycling performance, underlined by a good rate capability, high coulombic efficiencies and high average discharge capacity (117 mA h g

Introduction The interest in layered sodium-transition metal oxides, NaxMO2 (M ¼ transition metal, Ni, Co, Mn, Fe, Cr and others) is increasing signicantly in recent years.1–8 In fact, Na-based batteries appear to be a promising alternative when energy density is not a critical issue, e.g. for large scale energy storage and low-cost applications.9 Additionally, sodium is highly abundant and homogeneously distributed in the Earth's crust and sea water and, consequently, cheap.8,10,11 However, one great advantage of Na batteries is certainly the feasible replacement of copper with aluminium current collectors since Na does not alloy with this metal.12 This could represent substantial cost and weight savings for batteries.11,13 In layered NaxMO2, Na cations can be accommodated in trigonal prismatic (P), tetrahedral (T) or octahedral (O) sites between the MO6 octahedra. P-type materials nowadays are attracting interest due to their promising performance in sodium-ion batteries.

Over the last two decades, graphene and its derivatives have attracted lots of attention because of its peculiar properties. In this review, a general introduction, history, synthesis and applications of graphene and graphene oxide have been provided. However, we have emphasized the different synthetic routes adopted for synthesizing graphene oxide (GO). Till now, several methods have been developed for the synthesis of graphene oxide such as micro-mechanical, exfoliation of pyrolytic graphite; CVD, epitaxial growth, etc. Here in this review paper, we have discussed four methods for the synthesis of graphene oxide, namely Brodie’s method, Staudenmaier method, Hofmann method, and Hummer’s method. Mostly, graphene oxide has been synthesized by graphite oxidation. Because of excellent properties, chemical functionalization and ease of production graphene and its derivatives have made their way to various applications. Few of the applications of graphene oxide like in electronic devices, energy storage devices, biosensors, coating technology, and graphene oxide composites and paper-like materials have also been incorporated into this paper.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/251e7d56-64cd-4ae6-9584-bbdc43b6d154/1%20-%20Dec%2019.pdf,pdf

In this work, we present two methods for the chemical modification of silicon nanoparticles. Both methods change the materials’ electrochemical characteristics. The combined XPS and SEM results show that the properties of the generated silicon oxide layer depend on the modification procedure employed. Electrochemical characterization reveals that the formed oxide layers show different susceptibility to electro-reduction during the first lithiation. The single step oxidation procedure resulted in a thin and very stable oxide that acts as an artificial SEI layer during electrode operation. The removal of the native oxide prior to further reactions resulted in a very thick oxide layer formation. The created oxide layers (both thin and thick) greatly suppress the effect of silicon volume changes, which significantly reduces electrode degradation during cycling. Both modification techniques are relatively straightforward and scalable to an industrial level. The proposed modified materials reveal great applicability prospects in next generation Li-ion batteries due to their high specific capacity and remarkable cycling stability.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/9058391c-85f3-4371-a478-3c90db626964/molecules-25-04093-v2.pdf,pdf

Experimentally obtained graphene-based structures have been suggested to replace the state-of-the-art graphitic anode. For a thorough characterization of Li adsorption on graphene, we study the interaction of Li with graphene both at zero and finite temperatures. The zero-temperature study was carried out by means of density functional theory (DFT), accounting for van der Waals (vdW) interactions, whereas the finite temperature behavior was studied by Monte Carlo techniques with a DFT-derived Li–graphene interaction potential constructed via cluster expansion method. Our calculations reveal two distinct types of orderings of Li on graphene, Li-gas (dispersed Li-ion) and Li-cluster phases. The zero-temperature calculations show that, even when vdW is included, the Li–graphene interaction is mainly electrostatic and phase separation to pristine graphene and bulk Li is energetically most favorable. However, at nonzero temperatures, entropy contribution to free energy allows the lesser-ordered Li-gas and Li-cluster states to be more favorable at sufficiently low concentrations: at temperatures below 400 K and concentrations below 1Li:6C, Li-gas and Li-cluster phases coexist whereas at higher concentrations, only clusters remain stable. At temperatures above 400 K, Li-gas phase can be stabilized with respect to Li cluster or Li bulk at higher concentrations. Furthermore, small variations in chemical potential are shown to be enough to change that concentration threshold. Finally, we show that the Li-cluster phases can have Li-island or Li-stripe ordering; however, Li stripes appear due to the finite size of the simulation cell and therefore the Li-island phase is expected to dominate in the thermodynamic limit instead.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/732f98f1-5276-4b70-9c92-1721f2e36aab/DeGironcoli_JPCC2018.pdf,pdf

Graphene has been used as a key material in the technological applications in various areas such as sensors, drug delivery, super capacitors, transparent conductor, and solar cell. It has a superior quenching efficiency for various fluorophores. Based on these unique properties, the optical sensors with graphene materials as the energy acceptors have demonstrated great success in recent years. During quenching, the emission of a fluorophore is perturbed by a quencher which can be a substrate or biomolecule, and due to this phenomenon, fluorophore-quencher has been used for selective detection of target molecules. Among fluorescence dyes, 1,8-naphthalimide is well known for its typical intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and photo-induced charge transfer (PET) fluorophore, strong absorption and emission in the visible region, high photo stability, and large Stokes shift. Derivatives of 1,8-naphthalimides have found applications in some areas, especially fluorescence sensors. Herein, the fluorescence quenching of graphene oxide has been carried out on a naphthalimide dye as a fluorescent probe model.

The fabrication process of electrodes involves a mixing of active materials, a nonconductive polymeric binder material, and an electrically conductive additive. Binders play a critical role during the electrochemical process, which tightly holds the active materials together within the electrode to provide a long-cycle life. The present study investigates the strength of the interaction for different binders such as vinylidene fluoride (VDF), pyrrole (PY), styrene-butadiene (SB), acrylonitrile (AN), tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), and lignin monomers, coumarylalcohol (LCmA), coniferylalcohol (LCnA), and sinapylalcohol (LSiA), using density functional theory calculations. The result reveals that sustainable binders (CMC, LCmA, LiCnA, and LSiA) exhibit higher interaction energy than unsustainable binders (VDF, PY, SB, AN, and TFE). The highest interaction energy is obtained for the graphene-LiSiA system, followed by graphene-LCnA and graphene-LCmA. Comparing the orientation of the binders on the graphene surface, all binders make a face-to-face arrangement with graphene. This interaction is greatly enhanced for those binders that possess aromatic rings with functional groups (methoxy and hydroxyl). These results provide significant insights for the use of lignocellulosic biomass materials such as lignin and cellulose as binders in energy devices toward more sustainability.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/86aee31f-f2b0-476b-bc08-6ed7e01d216f/1-s2.0-S0169433221025137-main.pdf,pdf

Yttrium barium copper oxide has been prepared by polymeric precursor technique. Novelty of this work is the use of sodium polyacrylate which provides large number of -coo- groups for binding polyvalent metal ions like Y3+, Ba2+ and Cu2+. After decomposing the polymeric part, XRD study has been carried out with the ash and it has been found that the product is yttrium barium copper oxide although BaO is mixed. Composition of the product may be controlled by controlling the amount of metal nitrate solutions which are mixed with aqueous solution of sodium polyacrylate to get the polyvalent metal ion bound macromolecular system. IR spectral study has been carried out to understand ion binding by the macromolecular system and thermal analysis has been carried out to understand thermal behaviour of these systems.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/4a4396c3-c2b9-4019-8f09-69aecca7454f/1647-1652.pdf,pdf

supercapacitors and explain how they could decrease cost and environmental impact, and yet improve
the performance of electrochemical energy devices. The different classes of green binders reported
to date in the literature are firstly classified according to their processability (the solvent required for
electrode manufacturing), chemical composition (F-free), and natural availability (synthetic or bioderived).
The benefits originating from their employment are analysed for different devices. The most
popular lithium-ion batteries are thoroughly discussed both from the anode and the cathode side. While
high capacity Si-based anodes benefit from enhanced cyclability due to the interaction between the
active particles’ surface and the functional groups of, e.g., polysaccharides such as carboxymethyl
cellulose and alginate, the transition to water-processable cathodes is certainly more challenging. In
particular, strategies to suppress the aluminium corrosion affecting most lithiated transition metal oxides
are discussed. Despite the much more limited literature available, the role of the binder is increasingly
recognized in the emerging field of lithium–sulphur and sodium-ion batteries, and electrochemical

The results showed that after aging, the C/O ratio of graphene oxide increased from 1.96 to 2.76, but the type of oxygen-containing functional groups did not change. In addition to oxygen-containing functional groups, the content of -CH3, -CH2- and physically adsorbed water also decreased. The change in the structure is manifested by the reduction of the average interlayer distance from 1.320 nm to 1.134 nm. Moreover, ID/IG increased from 0.95 to 1.03, indicating that the defect density in the carbon skeleton increased after aging. The thermal decomposition process of graphene oxide and its decomposition products were analyzed by thermogravimetric combined with Infrared spectroscopy. When the temperature exceeds 60°C, the infrared signal of CO2 produced by the decomposition of graphene oxide can be detected. After aging, the decomposition peak temperature of graphene oxide decreased from 216 to 195°C. The amount of CO2 produced in the decomposition products is almost unchanged, while the amount of CO and H2O produced decreases, and the amount of SO2 produced decreases significantly. The OH radicals and heat accumulated during the decomposition process may in turn accelerate the decomposition rate, leading to a thermal runaway process at 216°C.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/4f49183e-cf61-45d4-a386-d7ca93890b3e/Data.xlsx,xlsx

Modular and intermountable designed battery packs enable the replacement of defective or outdated battery cells, allow additional cost savings and a prolongation of life time. This paper discusses opportunities for future remanufacturing value chains of electric cars and their battery components and how to address their potentials with elaborate designs. Based on a brief overview of implemented remanufacturing structures in different industries, opportunities of transferability are evaluated. In addition to an analysis of current and upcoming challenges, promising perspectives for a sustainable electric car circular economy enabled by design for remanufacturing are deduced. Two mathematical models describe the feasibility of pursuing a circular economy of lithium ion batteries and evaluate remanufacturing in terms of sustainability and economic efficiency. Taking into consideration not only labor and material cost but also capital costs for equipment and factory facilities to support the remanufacturing process, cost benefit analysis prognosticate that a remanufacturing battery can be produced more cost-efficiently. The ecological benefits were calculated on a broad database from different research projects which focus on the recycling, the second use and the assembly of lithium ion batteries. The results of this calculations show a significant improvement by remanufacturing in all relevant factors especially in the consumption of resources and greenhouse warming potential.

Throughout human history, major economic disruption has been due to technological breakthroughs.
Since 1990 the energy density of lithium-ion cells has increased by a factor of four and the cost has dropped by a factor of 10.
This has caused disruption to the energy industry, but advances are slowing.
The manufacturing and supply chain complexity means that the next big technology will take 15 years to dominate.
The academic literature charts this process of development and can be used to show what is in the pipeline.
Three candidates that have had a large increase in publication count are: lithium sulphur, solid-state, and sodium-ion technology.
From the level of investments in start-ups and academic publication counts, solid‑state cells are closest to maturity.
To identify disruption potential, look at uncertainty in performance. Cell lifetime in lithium-ion cells indicates room for improvement.
Define a new disruption metric: . Look for areas of industry that lower this metric.
Thermal management is a lucrative area for improvement. Cooling the cell tabs of a 5Ah cell reduces the lifetime cost by 66%, compared to 8%/pa for 13 years relying on cost reduction.
Second life applications lower the lifetime cost by using the remaining 75% of energy throughput available in a cell after use in an electric vehicle.
Drop-in changes to standard manufacturing processes enable huge disruption. Electrolyte additives can increase cell life by 10 times, lowering lifetime cost by 90% in a simple manufacturing intervention.

the design and realization of advanced energy storage systems. While different 3D printing techniques offer
great potential to design and develop 3D architectures, several factors need to be addressed to print 3D
electrodes, maintaining an optimal trade-off between electrochemical and mechanical performances.
Herein, we report the first demonstration of 3D printed Si-based electrodes fabricated using a simple
and cost-effective fused deposition modelling (FDM) method, and implemented as anodes in Li-ion
batteries. To fulfil the printability requirement while maximizing the electrochemical performance, the
composition of the FDM filament has been engineered using polylactic acid as the host polymeric
matrix, a mixture of carbon black-doped polypyrrole and wet-jet milling exfoliated few-layer graphene
flakes as conductive additives, and Si nanoparticles as the active material. The creation of a continuous
conductive network and the control of the structural properties at the nanoscale enabled the design and
realization of flexible 3D printed anodes, reaching a specific capacity up to 345 mA h g-1 at the current
density of 20 mA g-1, together with a capacity retention of 96% after 350 cycles. The obtained results

Thus, the capture of SO2 gas is very important for the environment. Graphene which is two-dimensional material has excellent mechanical, chemical, thermal properties, and many application areas such as energy storage devices, gas adsorption, sensing devices, and optical electronics. Further, graphene oxide (GO) is examined as a good adsorbent because of its important features such as functional groups (epoxy, carboxyl and hydroxyl) on the surface and layered structure. The SO2 adsorption properties of the fibers are usually investigated on carbon fibers. In this study, potential adsorption capacity of GO fibers was researched. GO dispersion was first obtained with Hummers’ method from graphite, and then GO fibers were obtained via wet spinning process. These fibers were converted into a disc shape, dried, and then subjected to SO2 gas adsorption test. The SO2 gas adsorption capacity of GO fiber discs was investigated in the fields of utilization of different coagulation baths and reduction by hydrazine hydrate. As coagulation baths, single and triple baths were used. In single bath, only ethanol and CaCl2 (calcium chloride) salt were added. In triple bath, each bath has a different concentration of water/ethanol and CaCl2 salt, and the disc obtained from triple bath has been called as reference disk. The fibers which were produced with single bath were flexible and rough, and the analyses show that they had higher SO2 adsorption capacity than triple bath fibers (reference disk). However, the reduction process did not increase the adsorption capacity, because the SEM images showed that the layers and uniform structure in the fiber form were damaged, and reduction decreased the functional groups which SO2 will be attached. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analyzes were performed on the fibers and discs, and the effects on the results were interpreted. In the future applications of the study, it is aimed that subjects such as pH and additives will be examined.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/e0c9b651-4baf-45d0-96b3-317ad8ede382/10007145.pdf,pdf

The organization of ions and structuring of water molecules close to a graphene interface, which represents an atomically thin surface, substantially affect the interfacial physicochemical properties in electrolytes as well as the specific capacitance of supercapacitors. Moreover, adsorption of ions on one side of the ultimately thin material may largely impact the adsorption of additional charge carriers on the opposite side and thus influence the overall supercapacitor performance. However, these phenomena are so far not fully understood. In this study, all-atomic classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted with explicitly included polarization, which is essential for accurate description of electrolytes at interfaces in systems containing carbon allotropes. We employed an isotropic polarization model using classical Drude oscillators and adjusted Thole parameters for graphene. This approach improved the classical description of graphene−electrolyte interaction although did not fully cover the inherent anisotropy of graphene polarization because the field components parallel to the graphene sheet were largely reduced but not completely screened as in semimetals. The MD simulations were applied to examine the interface between graphene and potassium halide solutions. The results showed that water molecules formed a well-organized single layer on both sides of graphene, which primarily acted as a hydrophobic structuring agent. This arrangement significantly contributed to effective shielding of ion−ion interactions acting through the graphene sheet. Thus, the ion-specific structuring of adjacent electrolytes on opposing sides of graphene was generally independent. The findings help to understand structuring of electrolyte on graphene-based electrode materials of supercapacitors.",Inconnu,Inconnu

LICs typically present limited energy densities at high power densities due to the sluggish kinetics of the battery-type electrode. To circumvent this limitation, the hard carbon (HC) was embedded in a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) matrix. The addition of rGO into the negative electrode not only forms a 3D interpenetrating carbon network but also wraps HC particles, facilitating ion diffusion and enhancing the electronic conductivity notably at high power densities. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis reveals that charge-transfer resistance at electrode-electrolyte interphase and the charge-transport resistance within the electrode are considerably lower in the presence of rGO. In addition, charge-transport resistance remains constant upon cycling even at increasing current densities. Capacity gain at high current densities, owing to the reduction of the electrode resistance, triggers the overall LIC performance, allowing for the assembly of an ultrafast LIC delivering up to 200 Wh kg−1 AM at low power rates and 100 Wh kg−1 AM at a power of 10 kW kg−1 AM.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/187f2db3-94b6-4990-8df2-c9a7dc5a82e5/J.%20Electrochem.%20Soc.-2019-Ajuria-A2840-8.pdf,pdf

Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) batteries are increasingly being deployed in EVs because of their high energy density, high cell-level voltage, and low rate of self-discharge. Since Li-ion batteries represent the most expensive component in the EV powertrain, accurate monitoring and control strategies must be executed to ensure their prolonged lifespan. The Battery Management System (BMS) has to accurately estimate parameters such as the battery State-of-Charge (SOC), State-of-Health (SOH), and Remaining Useful Life (RUL). In order for the BMS to estimate these parameters, an accurate and control-oriented battery model has to work collaboratively with a robust state and parameter estimation strategy. Since battery physical parameters, such as the internal resistance and diffusion coefficient change depending on the battery state-of-life (SOL), the BMS has to be adaptive to accommodate for this change. In this paper, an extensive battery aging study has been conducted over 12-months period on 5.4 Ah, 3.7 V Lithium polymer cells. Instead of using fixed charging/discharging aging cycles at fixed C-rate, a set of real-world driving scenarios have been used to age the cells.

The MGN@MC/S electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, with high reversible specific capacity and rate capability (1475 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C and 748 mA h g-1 at 1 C ), and long-cycle ability (0.042 % capacity decay per cycle over more than 450 cycles at 1 C).",https://zenodo.org/api/files/31898c7d-4eaf-4f9c-a502-ecb593d7ac7c/data.zip,zip
89,A study of the possibility of conducting selective laser processing of thin composite electrochromic Ni(OH)2-PVA films,10.15587/1729-4061.2021.225355,"Valerii Kotok, Vadym Kovalenko",2021-02-26,"The surfaces of thin composite electrochromic Ni(OH)2-polyvinyl alcohol films, deposited by the cathodic template method on FTO glass substrates, were proposed to be processed using laser radiation. The processing of these films was carried out in a colored state with a laser beam of a semiconductor emitter with a wavelength of 650 nm (red) with a pulse duration of 3,000 μs, the beam diameter was about 40 μm. The energy at a single point was 37.5 J/cm2.
The result was a film with microholes of about 80 μm. The transparent areas of the surface did not exhibit electrochromic properties, which indicated the absence of the original electrochromic coating.
The study of the properties of the laser-processed film following a certain pattern showed that the characteristics of composite Ni(OH)2-polyvinyl alcohol coatings had changed significantly. On the one hand, the coloration depth of the films decreased by several percent, on the other hand, the specific electrochemical characteristics increased significantly.
The study also showed that laser processing did not lead to significant changes in the main properties of the transparent electrically conductive layer – color and resistance. Before and after laser processing, the surface resistance of FTO glasses was 12.1±0.9 and 14.4±1.2 Ohm/sq., respectively.
 In addition, it was found that the processing of Ni(OH)2-polyvinyl alcohol films improved the adhesion of the latter to the surface of FTO glass. Based on the data obtained, a selective method was proposed for modifying thin colored films deposited on transparent conductive oxides (FTO, ITO, AZO) by visible laser radiation. This approach to changing the properties of films can be useful for areas related to the development of sensors, microelectronics, solar cells, small-sized current sources, electrodes with high efficiency, etc.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/c5ddb5d3-91f7-4f00-86d6-6b11a2a6fea9/6-15_A%20study%20of%20the%20possibility%20of%20conducting%20selective%20laser%20processing%20of%20thin%20composite%20electrochromic%20Ni%28OH%292-PVA%20films.pdf,pdf

The Faraday Discussion ""Chemistry of 2-dimensional materials: beyond graphene"" has been an incredible showcase for a variety of highly interesting contributions in the field. This conference comprised a large number of aspects of the topic: from their synthesis and the study of their optical and physical properties to their numerous applications. These concluding remarks aim to capture the recent developments in 2D materials chemistry and physics that were presented and debated during this Faraday Discussion, and more generally in the research field in recent years. Particular attention will be paid to aspects like the synthesis of the materials, their toxicity and biodegradation, and some of their major applications in catalysis, as well as Li-ion batteries, water filtration and sensing.

THE ACTION OF CHARCOAL ON SODIUM NITRITE ETC.,10.5281/zenodo.6669765,TRAMBAKLAL MOHANLAL OZA,1944-12-31,"Hyponitrites are formed by the action of charcoal on alkali nitrites. They, however, undergo double decomposition with the carbon dioxide formed in the reaction producing the alkali carbonate and nitrous oxide.
Sodium hyponitrite decomposes at 334-36° producing sodium oxide, nitrite and nitrate and liberating nitrogen. It appears likely that oxide and nitrite are the primary products and nitrate is the secondary product formed by auto-oxidation of the nitrite. This view receives support from the products of action of charcoal on sodium nitrite and hyponitrite.
Sodium hyponitrite is extraordinarily sensitive to carbon dioxide, fixing the latter becoming itself changed into the carbonate and setting nitrous oxide free. The sensitiveness is so unusual that it removes carbon dioxide even from air where it is present only to a small extent.",https://zenodo.org/api/files/47f13db9-d8a2-4dde-99c7-d62a5e5aeb85/71-78.pdf,pdf

The obtained sample exhibited a superior rate specific capability (113.3 mAh g-1 at 20 C) and adequate cycling stability when cycled at 1 C with a specific capacity retention of 84.8% after 100 cycles. In order to enhance the cycling performance of the sample, an in situ PANI coating strategy was employed in which aniline was added into the electrolyte and polymerized under electrochemical conditions.
